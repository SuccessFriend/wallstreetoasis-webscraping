This is sometimes the case (i.e. Marriott managing an asset under the W franchise/brand), but not something you should ever want as an owner. Operator fees (hotel management) and franchise fees (cost of brand) are completely different line items.\nIn many cases a franchise and the manager/operator of the property are not related, which means, as an example, some private third party management company might be the one responsible for operating and ensuring compliance of your hotel under the W flag. \nI find it interesting that you think changing from an unencumbered boutique asset to a flagged property is a more enticing business plan. I guess it could be if you're strategy is to operate limited-service assets. Our strategy is the exact opposite - buy a shitty flagged deal in a strong location and kick them out to create a way more attractive boutique property.  ",

You will see leases by operators for your casino/gaming hotels (ex. BX and MGM partnership. BX owns the RE and MGM leases and operates the said property).\nYou will have your franchised hotels, brand managed, or your independent of brand hotels. Franchised, simply put, you build/own a hotel and want to put a flag on it (Marriott, Hilton, etc.) so you execute a franchise agreement. The brand will likely propose Managing it as well, but typically you prefer to stay away from the big brands as managers. Boots on the ground they aren\u2019t terrible, but dealing with their corporate structure and crock of shit fees (Marriott\u2019s Program Service Fees are the biggest crock of shit) are awful to work with at the brand managed level. On the contrary, you can then Franchise your hotel and find a third party operator to manage (Highgate, HEI, Aimbridge, etc.). So you have the Marriott or whatever brand and reservation distribution system but a third party operator. Your franchise fees are usually a certain % of Room Revenue (3.5%-6%) and if you have a heavy F&B operation, could be fees off that. Your Operator will then take a Base Management Fee (standard is 3%) of Gross Revenue and typically will include an Incentive Management Fee.",

                "contentText": "Minor point, there is a difference with getting FTIO from Fannie vs Freddie. Easier to get from Fannie on some loans whether its big or small sponsors and this is a result of the differences in business models. Borrowers may not always know this, there is a difference between Fannie and Freddie business models. With Fannie, there is this concept of delegated loans. Meaning lenders are allowed to underwrite FTIO (amongst other things) as long as it checks some boxes (market, exit rate, LTV, etc this criteria is a super confidential contract between Fannie and the lenders and the criteria varies between lenders, obviously the more productive lenders get better/more lenient criteria). With Fannie, the lender holds onto a portion of risk when they underwrite loans. As a result of this risk sharing agreement, Fannie allows the lenders to do things like FTIO without requiring Fannie's approval as long as it checks some boxes. In theory, on some loans, lenders can quote and even app a deal without Fannie signing off on it. With Freddie, there is 0% risk for lenders, hence every loan is re-underwritten and lenders cannot quote anything without Freddie's signoff. This is why there is sometimes full term I/O with Fannie loans (it's not that Fannie signed of on it but as explained previously, lenders can quote that on their own without Fannie's sign off) but not with Freddie loans, they usually quote half term I/O for 1.25x loans and FTIO for only 1.35x loans.

Website says they have $95 billion USD in AUM globally, which makes them 'mega fund' by status in real estate (not sure how that breaks down by fund class, asset class, debt v. equity, etc.).\nThe name is still \"household\" in my opinion, so if started a career there and wanted/needed to exit, I'm sure you would do okay. Is it the name that everyone \"fights\" to go work for today? nope, but that may be a smart reason to pursue it..... \nOne final warning/caveat... I've heard they moved a lot of the RE team to Connecticut (and not just Stamford...), that can be a downside to many (like bro... you don't work in NYC.. stop pretending lol).  ",

When you combine all these things together it allows you to click a button and excel import data, interpret it, and spit out a results in the format you want. It can be pretty powerful. It also is pretty easy to instantly finish repetitive tasks that are a time sink. I don't even use VBA that frequently but it's saved me countless hours from the times I do need it.",

A lot of people don't realize that pivot tables don't auto update, so someone will be looking at base data and change something and then flip over to the pivot table you created and have no idea that it didn't update itself. But you can program VBA to do that for you.\nIf I'm working on a large project with a shared workbook, I use VBA to build an audit log so I know who changed what.\nAlso, automated reporting is a big one for me. I get downloads from accounting, valuations, middle office, etc. and have to create quarterly reporting. All of the downloads look exactly the same each quarter, so I automated all of the importing, formatting and a lot of the calculations. Once base data is checked, I can click a couple of macros and the reports look exactly like last quarter without having to remember if this was left justified or center and if that was accounting or number formatted.\nI'm the only person in my shop that knows VBA/some of the advanced Excel techniques like array formulas. Definitely can be useful, but mostly because it makes your life easier. Nobody is going to really care that you know it.",

I summered on a different desk requiring little technical abilities, but my new MD told me being able to program would be useful as few others on the desk are any good at it.\nI know a bit of R and VBA from a few classes I took in my final year, and want to make sure I'm at least marginally useful on the desk early.\nAny ideas?

Use both Linest and Solver to calculate the relationship over different time frames (last 6 months, 2 years, 5 years, etc.) to come up with trade ideas.\nThen, make a more generic version of your spreadsheet so that any relationship (curve, fly, condor) can be analyzed this way. Then use the generic tool you built to search for trade ideas.\nThen add other things to the data set you are using to find correlations (S&P 500 index, Spot Crude Oil price, FX like USD/JPY and EUR/USD, foreign govt yields like German and UK 10yr yields). Search for relationships that come and go under different time frames. Try to think like a prop trader. If you could trade anything and everything among all the spot instruments, what would you trade and why. Use your tool to help answer that question. Relationships come and go depending on what is happening in the world. Try to explain divergences in the relationships you find with world events at the time of the divergence...you will find that sometimes, the data does indeed tell a story.",

                "contentText": "Billy Beane offers a good initial outline on how to get this done. I would suggest researching VBA and trying to improve the code.\nFor example, the first part of the code enters formulas into a sheet so that you can eventually determine the dates to use in the file name. So you should look into a way where the code doesn't have to insert the formals into a sheet, it would just assign variables the date values directly.\nYou can google this stuff and get answers, i did a quick search with \"excel vba last month\" and found a forum post with this answer, MyMonth = Format(DateAdd(\"m\", -1, Date), \"mmmm\") which saves a bunch of lines of code. of course you should research each of the functions in there to understand what it means and to make sure it will work for all dates. This site is good because it gives an explanation of formulas and also shows how to use it in VBA, http://www.techonthenet.com/excel/formulas/\nSo if you wanted to quickly see what the above is doing, you can just open new sheet and run this:\nSub test()\nMyMonth = Format(DateAdd(\"m\", -1, Date), \"mmmm\")\nSheet1.Range(\"A1\") = MyMonth\nEnd Sub\nAlways make sure you think about all possibilities and QA your code. What if someone doesn't name the file right that you are trying to open? VBA would just toss a random error, but you can put some code in that has a pop up that says something like, \"Error in code, check to make sure the file name is formatted like blahblahblah\". Then you can expand on this, like adding a popup box where you can select what data to copy over. Some good websites are ozgrid and MrExcel.",

I figured some people here are probably decent at them, while I am pretty bad at them.\nIts a simple task, but I can't figure out how to do it.\nBasically, I want (this is only one section of the macro) a formula (remain constant) to be copied down a column, to the last row of data of another row.\nExample: Column A has B1&C1&D1 (concatenate) - this is the formula that I want to be copied down.\nColumb B/C/D obiviously has a bunch of data. However, this data is copied in from a program/report, and the number of lines varies (ie could be 10k, or 50k).\nThe Problem: I need to figure out how to program the action of Column A's formula, being copied down to the last row of data in B/C/D. I could just leave the concatenation formula in all 65k lines, but my boss doesnt want that and it makes the file a pain to deal with.\nAnyone? I'm sure this is easy, but I've tried a bunch of IF and COUNT formulas to measure the last row of data and such, but all have either failed or just make the file even bigger and less manageable.\nthanks",

                "contentText": "VBA help for valuation purpose (Originally Posted: 11/22/2014)\nHi WSO,\nMy VBA knowledge is fairly limited, and I have been asked to do some change on a valuation template.\nBasically, I have two excel sheets respectively showing historical data and projections. Let's say cell A15, on another \"lead\" sheet, is the cell where I input my \"number of historical periods\", and A16 is the one for #projection periods.\nWhat I need, is to make the number of columns dependent on the inputs. Concretely, if A15=10 in the leadsheet, I want to see 10 columns in the sheet showing the historical data, and the same goes with the projections on the other sheet.\nAny help on that would be immensely appreciated.",

I had an interview a couple weeks ago with CenterPoint Properties for an analyst position that would work 50/50 with the investment (existing properties) and development teams. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with them or is aware of their perception in the industry?\nI don't want to give too much away about myself, but just in case it helps for some reason, I'm from a major, major non-target (small school in Iowa) but I do have some internship experience with commercial real estate and found that pretty interesting.\nThank you in advance for the replies.",

While I can't say I have a lot of respect for CalPERS investments, GI is generally viewed as a shrewd investor in platform opportunities (they institutionalized the data center business through the creation of Digital Realty Trust).\nIf you are interested in real estate and think you could enjoy working in industrial development, probably not a bad place to start.",

If so, where/how do you show your other cash flows?\n2) When showing your interest, do you show it in both financing and operating cash flows? Because it's normal to show debt obligations below CFO, but you don't show other financing fees like origination and non-utilization fees. Curious on that.\n3) Can someone tell me where they put corporate income tax and capital gains tax, for both levered and unlevered income and capital gains? And what is the formula for all four of these?\nEx:\nInvestment/ Reversion CF\nPurchase Price\nSelling Price\nSelling Costs\nOp.

If so, where/how do you show your other cash flows?\n2) When showing your interest, do you show it in both financing and operating cash flows? Because it's normal to show debt obligations below CFO, but you don't show other financing fees like origination and non-utilization fees. Curious on that.\n3) Can someone tell me where they put corporate income tax and capital gains tax, for both levered and unlevered income and capital gains?

Is it as simple as pitching the shit out of any capital source until you find someone with enough liquidity and net worth to be a sugar daddy for a few deals and then just scale from there?",

A friend of mine knows them somewhat well and he has worked with them a little. Some gossip follows for what it is worth.\nThey buy crumby C+/B- stuff, maybe some B/B+ too, and put lots of lipstick on it. They have a fondness for wood paneling, and they do nice - but expensive - interior unit work. As far as operational efficiency and ability to hit a capital budget...I have heard mixed things. While their lip service indicates that they view their properties as long term holds, they have apparently traded in and out of stuff very fast without typically fully completing their capital plans. \nIn 2020/2021/2022, you could thoughtlessly dump a metric ass-load of cash into any class C or B property in the United States, get NOI up through rent increases, and make yourself look like a hero on the exit. I think that cap rate compression has been their very good friend. I assume that as young guys who believe themselves to be hot shit, they must be very good salesman on the capital trail.\nNow that the times have changed, I assume they find themselves having overpaid for a chunk of their recent deals, perhaps in places where the rent roll growth that they hoped for is slowing. They devoured a lot of bridge debt, all of which was issued when their properties' values were peak. Those notes will come due soon and I am not sure whether they have been disciplined or strategic enough to increase their NOI enough to both pencil out to satisfactory long term debt or to actually pay the debt service on such debt if they were to qualify for it.\nIf you want to buy some perpetual value-add multi that has already had a couple of bites taken out of it, and you have the appetite to continue doing some unit renos knowing exactly what the premiums on Tides' vintage look like, it could be a good buy.

They got lucky, granted, but it's not sustainable, they're not too big to fail though they may think so.\nI mean, nothing shady.  Debt was dirt cheap and multifamily is a hot sector.  People on here saying things like \"you can't deceive the credit committee at a non-recourse lender,\" which anyone who has ever gone through a credit committee knows is an absolute joke.\nI know nothing specific about the firm or their assets, but any group that grows this fast, especially in the markets in which they're active (which are all overheated anyway) is probably just underwriting deals extremely loose and churning for fees.  I say this all the time, but underwriting a deal and buying it is super easy.  It takes almost no intelligence or skill, just confidence and connections with equity partners and lenders.  It's the execution that is tough, and from comments on this thread it sounds like Tides doesn't do much in the way of executing on a business plan. So yeah, I'm sure they made millions of dollars in fees... but there is no back end.  IRRs will always look great if you get lucky with a macro environment and get in and out of a deal in 9 months.\nSuccess in real estate isn't about who does well when times are good, it's about how survives the downturns and comes out the other side with their reputation intact.  We've had a decade+ of boom times in which a ton of crappy operators probably got bailed out because the 10th person came along and said \"hey, I'll install new countertops and appliances and bump rents by 25%, too!\"  Well, none of those suckers are going to be around in a recession or tight capital market to hold the bag, so we're about to see whose success was \"cheap debt\" and whose was actual ability to execute.  Somehow, I don't think a ten man shop doing a dozen deals a year is the latter.",

We can sit here all day and talk about how \"fees are the meat\" but some fees are like a ribeye and some are discount ground beef.  They claim to have $8b in AUM... how did they calculate that?  Does that mean they bought 8b of assets, or did they buy $34b of assets and then slap some crazy cap rates on there to get to a fun valuation?  Did they make a point on all that?  Half a point?  These are meaningful questions when you think about their \"success\".  $20mm in fees versus $80mm is obviously a huge discrepancy.  Do they have recourse on the bridge debt they've taken out?  Because it's easy to say \"fees can't be wiped out\" but they 100% can if the bank comes knocking and wants assets back that are 90% levered and the founders have guarantee risk.\nGenerally speaking, I find it hard to believe that these guys managed to buy a \"real\" $8b of real estate while charging enormous fees and taking no guarantee risk.  That just doesn't pass the sniff test, and while we'll never know the absolute truth (unless one of their investors is lurking around) it just defies all logic that a couple of complete unknowns managed to access billions of dollars of equity within the space of a few years without putting up guarantees and while taking enormous fees.  Their website claims that they've \"transacted\" on $9b of real estate and 45,000 units.  Maybe someone else here knows better, but does $200,000/unit make sense for Class B/C multifamily that needs real work make sense?  One of the projects mentioned in the Real Deal was bought for 125,000/unit; even if you assume those valuations were a little lower in summer 2022 than would have been the case in 2021, that's still a massive difference.",

You really think they were dumb enough to roll their fees into the deals cmon. All their debt is non-recourse for a reason. Obviously if bad boys come into play its a different story but I haven't seen any allegations of outright fraud and feel like they were smarter than that but we'll see. BS UW is not illegal. \nI bet when they started out (at a very PERFECT time I might add) they did normal deals, absolutely smashed them outta the park, and used that success to secure big capital partners and tight relationships with brokers. At that time, they cared about returns and promote because that's what they were working for, and they got it. I read as time when on, they very astutely started putting less and less equity into deals - at this point I would imagine their business plan changed closer to the cardone playbook. They created a monster machine, the one guy literally prides himself on it and quotes it - at this point they didn't care about returns. They already made their nut, now they just wanted to create a fee printing press. Acquisition, development, asset management and whatever else they charged. You basically had two guys hoarding mountains of fees - you really think they gave a fuck about returns anymore? Literally everyone says their uw was an overly aggressive shitshow they were just selling the dream and definitely knew it. They took everyone to the cleaners and made a killing and I bet they dgaf if they're done after this they can probably retire. \nJust my 2 cents. Either way grabbing the popcorn to see how this all unfolds this year. ",

Seriously, what a waste of time if you do not have loan documents, SREO, PFS, actual operations data, etc. So much is wrong on here, for starters- no, not all (a lot but not all ) of their loans are non recourse, there is some recourse with burn off tests on some loans, and it's laughable to think there were no caps or swaps in place lol, like wtf?

Look at the guys at the top of the list, now follow a few steps, 1. download that list, 2. subtract their last years total apartments by the current year total apartments, 3. sort by largest to smallest. You see where all those guys from the top went, straight to the bottom, i.e. they were selling all their shit or didn\u2019t buy nearly anything, look who\u2019s at the top (spoiler Tides is top 3). You bought all your shitty assets at the top of the market, so no, not something most of the people want to try and create.\nSure your REO is impressive, when you\u2019re the one valuing the assets, and throwing sub 4 caps on all those assets with fake NOIs, but go try and let an independent 3rd party audit that. That would be a big negative lol.\nYou think your non-recourse is safe? You have carry guarantees, completions guarantees, bad boy carve outs, etc etc. Those don\u2019t just go away, especially the completions when you\u2019re telling you entire AM team to notify you when you\u2019ve completed 1/5th of your renovations and to call it quits because you will want to use that capex reserve to supplement your cash flow and debt service. Yes, those will trigger bad boys when the lenders find out.\nI know you\u2019ve never really been in an investment committee, since you were a low level AM analyst at a bottom tier company, but yes it\u2019s pretty easy to get things through them. Also those rate caps will kill you when you have to buy them again to meet your extension covenants, some of which expire during the initial term, and the spreads alone are eating away at your 60% occupied sub 4 cap deals. Forget the extensions though, nothings getting you to those maturities, unless your pref money just enjoys burning cash.\nBest outcome here is that you can end up sharing a cell with Sam Bankman-Fried, he seems like he\u2019s a top though so idk.

I\nTell me you've never been through an IC process without telling me you've never been through an IC process.  I mean, seriously, your entire post reeks of someone who has no clue what they're talking about.  In a cheap credit environment, there is nothing easier than convincing an investment committee to veer off of best practices.  That is why hugely sophisticated VC firms invested in obviously fraudulent companies like FTX - demanding oversight or diligence means losing a deal.  Same goes for real estate.\nFor example, \"actual operations data\".  You bring this up as if no one can understand how well a company manages its assets, but the truth is the opposite.  Most costs can be figured out fairly well, because the biggest line items like insurance, taxes, and utilities tend to be pretty tightly grouped and thus there is a fair bit of transparency there.  Maybe not exact... but if I'm out getting quotes for property and liability insurance at $1,000/unit, I guarantee you that no one is finding someone who is insuring their property for half that.  Sure, electricity usage can vary a bit... but not enough to make a major difference.  And guess what?  These guys are short term holders, they're doing a shit rehab and flipping the property in the hopes of cap rate compression or major rental growth.  Even if they could do all of this insanely cheaply, they're not holding the assets long enough for it to kick in - whoever buys the building(s) is going to sub in their own underwriting assumptions which are probably going to be more in line with the market.\nFinally, the true tip off that you don't really know what you're talking about comes from your obsession with the NMHC Top 50 List.  Who cares?  Number of units owned isn't even a good proxy for deal size.  A firm that is buying 10,000 units in southwest Ohio with 80% leverage isn't putting up more equity than someone buying a 750 unit portfolio in Brooklyn for 65% leverage.  Beyond that, what is more impressive, owning 1% of 1,000 units or 10% of 500?  The point being, stop obsessing over the glitz of \"xx thousand units\" (which is what the Tides people care about, evidently) and start thinking about it in terms of what kind of returns can be earned, and why, and how.  These guys, like many others, seem to be playing a massive game of musical chairs, and churning fees all the while.  And great, for a while they'll make a little bit of money.  But when the music stops, they'll lose all of it, because they're not in these deals with zero risk so even the earned fees end up being at risk.\nAlso I strongly suspect a lot of these lists are influenced by self-reporting.  I can name at least three companies that should be on the 2021 list and aren't.  Which means there are probably many, many, many more that I have never heard of and which also choose not to be listed.",

Objectively speaking, they're more likely to have guaranteed higher LTV debt or riskier deals.  That's how banks work; when the collateral sucks, they demand guarantees.  So if valuations are well down, it means that they're likely underwater on a couple of their loans.  And this may come as a shock to you, but it takes a lot of fee revenue to make up for even a small number of defaults on guaranteed loans.\nTo reiterate: when something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  Maybe these guys are the soul of caution, and are just geniuses at sourcing off market deals.  There is a low, but non-zero, chance that is true.  What is far more likely is that they're way out over their skis, that they've decided to bet it all on black and spin the wheel, that they took a lot of high leverage, risky loans to pay for their rapid expansion and were hoping that the music kept playing so they could keep finding new buyers at ever-increasing prices.  From a gut check perspective, what makes more sense?  That two complete newcomers to the industry unlocked some magical formula for unprecedentedly rapid success?  Or that two complete newcomers to the industry tapped into the same strategy that many before them had done, and offered extremely attractive terms to their equity investors to bring in capital and then went out and over-levered the shit out of their properties while putting in a bare minimal amount of effort into operations in order to deliver on those returns?\nI know which option my money is on.  I have no inside information except basic logic and a knowledge of the industry, and neither does anyone else on here, which is why I find it so incredible that the Tides guys have so many full-throated defenders.  If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's safe to assume it is a duck.  If it walks like a dangerously over leveraged company and talks like a dangerously over leveraged company, well...",

You're argument is \"I know people who have done deals with them\"?  Unless you are one of the principals at Tides, you're just as far away from \"first hand knowledge\" as I am. \nMoreover, you are actively disproving your own objectively awful take, because if you read through this thread, it's person after person saying \"I know a little bit about what is going on there and it's a giant shit show.\"  You have this idea that these two guys are geniuses, and you're defending them wholeheartedly, for no apparent reason.  The people who seem to have some direct interaction with Tides are saying that they're in a lot of trouble.  Common sense dictates they're in a lot of trouble.  What possible reason do you have to think they're doing well?  Because they own a lot of units?  I can name a number of prominent developer/owners off the top of my head who own a ton of units and who are in a ton of trouble because all of their underwriting assumptions have gotten blown out of the water.  Even the best operators in the business aren't immune to it.  You know what the difference is?  Most operators didn't buy tens of thousands of units with insanely cheap debt, in markets that were experiencing historic rent growth.  Tides had to outbid everyone else in order to win these deals; on its face that means they're at least somewhat stressed on most of them.  \nThe self-professed strategy is to buy with high leverage, high cost bridge debt, do the usual \"replace countertops\" rehab, jack rents and then sell.  The fact that they've grown so rapidly so recently with that strategy is exactly why I expect they're in trouble - they needed cheap credit and explosive rent growth in order to make their numbers work, both of those things are either long gone or on their way out the door.\nSo if you don't fall into one of those categories, you are pretty far out from the first hand knowledge and even further removed from the facts.",

What value creation you must have done, definitely a home run. I wonder who would buy it for such a stupid price? Oh that was Tides again, you bought it from yourself when it couldn't sell on market and recaped with CIM. yikes. Well I'm sure you put on some long term agency money right? Oh wait nope the prospectus from MF1 suggests you put a 80% LTV loan at SOFR+460? Woah sure that 3% rate cap (7.60% current rate if my math is right) is saving you, because that $132M purchase price must have been at a 6 cap lol. Oh to make matters worse it looks like its a 2 year initial term, so really trying to give yourself a long horizon there, with all those guarantees.\nJust another opinion.\nThat's just one deal and 10 min of digging on Costar and Trepp, keep talking on here and your going to get your team hurt more!

I\u2019ll try to keep in concise because the work is just getting started.\nI think it makes sense to make it a bit bigger along the lines of this post. We all agree Tides is done, by far the worst of them all, but I think a lot of it goes back to the greedy enablers who let this all transpire, the lenders. Whenever there is a looming economic retreat, it always gets traced back to the lenders who thought they were being smarter, driven by fees, and protected by moral hazard.\n\nThe biggest loser of those lenders is MF1 (Who had i5? BINGO!). They gave Tides billions, but couldn't have just stopped with those idiots, the need more idiots to hand money to for fees. CLO MF1 2022-FL9. I started off looking into a few properties that were having some pain, such as Tides at Gilbert East, which a few weeks ago experienced a tragedy with a 14 year old boy getting shot at the property. When I pulled up the CLO, obviously it was MF1, so I scanned for Tides, and so many properties popped up. There are 40 properties totaling $1.5B in this CLO, 8 of them are Tides, which makes up 19% of the \u201cdiversified\u201d offering. Some of the notes are structed in AB, because the commitment would be closer to 35% of the offering. The total initial funding of all the Tides notes in this one CLO is $285M, $48M future funded, and the actual total commitment is $522M. That\u2019s A lot.\n\nAs I was digging into these, which btw these values are nearly all below par (probably 65 cents at MF1 basis), I noticed there was one asset with a huge commitment in this CLO. One portfolio called LA Lofts Portfolio has a initially funded amount of $225M ($23M future), and $329M total commitment. That one portfolio makes up 15% of the CLO. This one was to Laguna Point, you know the group that was all over the real estate outlets about defaulting\u2026 on THIS NOTE! Combining Tides + Laguna, that 33% of this CLO that you can probably just say buh bye to. I had to look at the second largest note in this one. ZMR Capital lol. Zamir who\u2019s the CEO of the group is the same as Sean Kia (Tides) or Zach Haptonstall (Rise48) or Swapnil Agarwal (Nitya). They idolize Cardone and Carroll and think this is all they need to do, buy buy buy, crumby multi with high leverage floating debt, and have never worked at real institutional CRE firm. Not going to write too much more about this, everyone can go on pull the MF1 2022-FL9 offering and review the individual asset, but on a sponsorship basis, it\u2019s clearly crap. That ZMR loan is called The Reserve at Brandon, for $93M ($25M future) and $207M commitment. Makes up 6% of the CLO and bring the total sum of Tides+Laguna+ZMR to 40% of the CLO. Can confidently say if you own any of the MF1 offerings, you\u2019re probably going to be seeing some losses. \nSystems broken. Pain to come.",

Anybody can look at Trepp, presales or publicly available data and try to extrapolate but in the sources you look, you will however not find data from loans by balance sheet lenders, these are loans held on the balance sheet and are not securitized. You have the money center banks, lifecos  and also some debt funds (some of them also keep loans in their BS) who fit this profile. I am guessing you dont have access to a SREO, I do. Any guesses how many loans are financed for Tides by MF1 or lenders who utilized CLO's? I can answer that question- it is a lot smaller than you think, so you root for them to fail and post long paragraphs on here if you think it's a good use of your time and you can try to find whatever data you want to help your thesis but just keep in mind you have no idea how the loans/assets are performing when it comes to loans held on the balance sheet.

If you close on the deal and add rent growth if 3%, all of a sudden rents are $1,272 at market. Rent probably haven\u2019t grown by 3% on closing. So having no rent growth year 1 makes sense. \n  However, if you model rent growth monthly, you only reach $1,272 in rent in month 12 (or 13) depending on if you begin rent growth in month 1 or 2.

I personally wouldn't bother modeling monthly or using actual turnover/expiration dates from the rent roll, would rather just eyeball it and if units are mostly turning late in the year then use low/zero growth or high LTL in year one.  Actual turns never match initial UW anyway because things like early terminations and renewal rates can be unpredictable (unless you're non-renewing intentionally).",

Are you buying heavy value add and selling right when you stabilize? \nPartially because we're in NYC affordable housing, and rent growth in rent stabilized buildings is tough to predict but rarely high.  On a Section 8 property the OCAFs are a little more predictable, but rarely outpaced expense growth - you catch all that up in your mark up to market.  Partially because the buildings we buy have generally been suffering from underinvestment for years due to poor management, so we assume that even with a robust capital improvement program we're going to find inefficiencies we simply cannot iron out.  Partially because we're conservative and would rather overshoot our underwriting than fall flat on our face and get our/our investors money wiped out.  Partially because our value add is navigating an extremely difficult regulatory and political environment, and having the reputation of putting in the extra dollar to improve tenants' living experience can be a massive aid in that process.  Also, think about how many shops are going to have an extremely difficult year ahead of them, because they underwrote whatever crazy rent growth they had to in order to get funded, and now are staring down the barrel of an environment in which expenses are shooting up and a recession (with attendant lower rents/more slowly increasing rents) is looming.

That is why they gave you their cards. It is perfectly fine, don't need to over complicate this. This is literally how the world works.\nMy advice, if you have genuine questions, need insights, need help, etc... reach out. But just looking for ways to stay in touch to build relationships for the sake of it is probably not that mutually beneficial. There is really no need to \"hide\" your intent about wanting a job.... they know you want a job.... you are in college, that is literally the whole point of it.... graduate and get hired! I mean, exactly what track do you think these people followed in their life?\nEveryone who is \"senior\" was once \"junior\", and all those in the industry/field were once not. Most started in UG after high-school, and not all had parents with connections. Thus, when someone who is \"senior\" or even \"junior\" is offering to help a student it is really done out of pure \"pay it forward\" intent. Someone helped them, now they get to offer the help. If they want to advance your resume internally, just ask, they probably will if they like you and think you will fit into the firm. \nThere is no magic here, just how the world works! ",

If you skills/job are nationwide in focus, or not market specific, you can move all over (many jump from NYC to LA all the time). It is more difficult to job hunt in a distant market, as networking and even going to interviews is just more logistically difficult, so you need to invest a ton more time (and some dollars in airfare/hotel from your account) to make it work, but it happens all the time. \nI will say, going from \"mega\" market to other mega market is easier than small market to big market.

I also told most recruiters I would be living in NY for at least 5 years, which is true. So after awhile, some firms were open to it and eventually got an offer after convincing the firm I wouldn't dip out on NY within a year. \nEdit: the process took over 9 months and probably hundreds of applications, so you really gotta put the work in if you want it.

It's all mental math and it really fucked me up. \nThey say you cannot erase anything and give you a pencil.  It was just a bit rattling. \nAnswers were far from round numbers, and from what I remember, one question consisted of a purchase price, uneven CFs, and a higher sale price, and they wanted you to calc IRR and sponsor's total profit as they gave two-tier IRR hurdles.  I started laughing after I panicked because it was clearly just to see how you would go about answering it and not expecting a down-to-the-dollar answer.  Still, though, fuck that. Give me an Excel and a very short time window, a pencil-based pop quiz, is just unnecessary, especially for an off-cycle non-structured interview.\nAm I bitter, sure.",

Unfortunately (at least in my market), if you work at Greystone you\u2019d never be awarded a institutional deal like one of those firms.

There's really only 10 people who make money in the firm, most of which are the CEO's sons (hellooooo nepotism) but then again if I owned the firm I'd certainly be looking out for my children as well.  The remaining 5-6 people (all men) have been there forever, have large teams and the profits are all funneled their way.  The pay is awful (house takes a huge cut) and good luck finding clients that aren't already covered.  Diversity is non-existent so unless you are a jewish male I would look elsewhere. ",

                "contentText": "CMBS Origination - How do CMBS origination teams at banks stack up against one another? (Originally Posted: 06/10/2015)\nCurious to know what everyone's opinion is on CMBS origination teams at certain banks. Obviously JPM, DB, etc are strong, but more curious about the smaller (relatively), yet established programs (Barclays, Citi, etc). Looking for any insight in terms of general perception in the market from all angles (those in CMBS/CRE lending, borrowers, capital markets), corporate culture, salary, and generally anything you would want to know when considering these options as prospective future employers. Any insight will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

                "contentText": "Can't really classify/rate/stereotype orgination teams across each bank. Teams generally have their own culture that stems from the lead originator. Base salaries will be fairly similar at all of the aforementioned shop.\nBonus is much more dependent on how your origination team performs (i.e. amount and profitability of loans the lead originator brings in), rather than how, for example, Citi's commercial real estate finance group performs over the course of the year.\nOne of the few defining characteristics between banks is their risk tolerance. Shops like UBS and Loancore tend to go after loans further out on the risk spectrum, which are generally more profitable. So there may be higher upside, and downside, at those platforms.\nThe best advice I can give is that if you are joining an origination team as a junior member (analyst or associate) make sure you are joining a team with a strong lead originator. If the lead originator sucks, it doesn't matter which bank employs you. You will not get paid.\nDuring the interview process, ask how much they have originated each year over the past few years and their pipeline/expectations for the current year. Anything over $500MM per annum is reasonably strong. That's a good start.",

                "contentText": "CMBS is in the crapper for sure but it doesn't have anything to do with Trump. The problems with CMBS are related primarily to two points -- (1) dislocations in marketplace resulting from Dodd Frank risk retention rules imposed at the end of 2016 impacting issuers and lower tranche CMBS bond (B piece) buyers and (2) the continued low interest rate environment creating competition from Agency, lifeco/balance sheet and bank lenders. A lot has been written about the impacts of risk retention on the CMBS market, including on this board, so I'm not going to rehash that. The primary benefits of CMBS used to be higher leverage and 10 year non-recourse debt with decent periods of IO; the downside was prepayment obstacles, either with defeasance or yield maintenance. Nowadays, banks of all sizes are offering up to 7 year non-recourse deals without the prepayment hassles for better quality deals. Agency and lifeco lenders are taking all the quality lower leverage deals. Also, problems in the bond markets created situations where CMBS lenders couldn't quote rates to their borrowers until, or even after, closing. Therefore, CMBS deal quality has gone down -- you see lot of secondary market stuff, retail, limited service hospitality, etc.\nThat said, CMBS can still be a good option for really big single asset or single borrower portfolios deals. Not sure when or how this all gets worked out. CMBS will continue to have tough times but other capital providers should continue to do just fine.",

It\u2019s a rotational program so this would only be my first desk. My interests lie in securitized / structured products. I\u2019m at a top 3 BB in the space.\n1. Non-Agency RMBS\nPROS: the associate loves me and he\u2019s cool. The product is sexy and interesting. Probably has the best chances of HF exits if I\u2019m into that. \nCONS: very complex. Steep learning curve. Director of team is a stud but I think the only reason I\u2019m here is because the Associate loves me.\n2. CMBS Structuring\nPROS: structuring role is ideal for my first rotation as I\u2019m trying to learn that process. I also prefer more of a deal-based environment (I think). Heavier on the excel modeling which I like.\nCONS: from other CMBS threads I don\u2019t think you love this space\u2026 but personally it\u2019s mainly about the hours being a little long and I\u2019m not quite as close with the team.\n3. Spread Product / Structured Product Repo\nPROS: MD on this desk loves me and is super nice / well connected. Could bode well for building my network and getting on a favorable desk second rotation. Additionally because it\u2019s repo I\u2019m exposed to virtually all spread / structured products.\nCONS: arguably the \u201cleast sexy\u201d / most subject to automation down the line.",

                "contentText": "I don't think it's particularly hard to end up in a producer role. It's commissioned or on a draw, analysts are overhead. I think being a successful producer is another story though. Sure many shops will \"groom\" you into becoming a producer when you start out as an analyst, but I think your ability to bring in clients is really going to be determinant of your success. When your younger you're just starting to grow your network, and most people in your network are likely to be near your age and not worth a lot, at least the ones who'd be open to doing business with you. Hence, the string of older producer have grown their networks over the years, and a lot of those clients are now more capable of taking on deals and needing a mortgage broker.\nMost producers who are young and successful are likely coming in with some list of clientele, plain and simple. This could be from the producer you worked with as an analyst who is now retired and passing off business to you, or you're already connected in the circle, as in your parents know people and are connecting you. The former happens but I've seen many producers essentially still work during retirement age.",

                "postContent": "Came across this incredibly interesting story in this week's Commercial Mortgage Alert - apparently some guy altered a bunch of leases & rent rolls for his portfolio of Walgreens and was able to fraudulently overborrow from Benefit Street, who went on to securitize said paper.\nI'm just going to leave the full story below, but curious to know if anyone has more insight here.\n\"Industry pros are abuzz about a fraudulent borrower who induced Benefit Street\nPartners to write a large loan on 24 Walgreens stores in 10 states \u2014 with some also\nraising questions about the lender\u2019s due-diligence practices.\nBenefit Street, a New York-based unit of Franklin Templeton Investments, originated\nthe $149.7 million mortgage on April 18. A large portion of the debt is now\nheld by Franklin BSP Realty Trust, a public mortgage REIT managed by Benefit\nStreet.\nThe triple-net-leased collateral properties are owned by Raheel \u201cRay\u201d Bhai, the\nchief executive of Addison, Texas-based investment firm IBF Properties, who is\nbeing sued by Benefit Street for fraud.\nSince the REIT disclosed the incident on an earnings call last week, rival bridge\nlenders have marveled over the extent of the fraud. They also have wondered how\nthe lender, which securitized portions of the floating-rate debt via two commercial real estate CLOs, overlooked certain warning signs that seem clear in hindsight.\nCompetitors have focused in particular on the reported rents and lease terms for the collateral properties, which Benefit Street now claims were significantly overstated by the borrower. Noting that many of the properties are in rural areas, one industry veteran said Benefit Street and other commercial real estate professionals who worked on the deal should have suspected they were being overvalued.\n\u201cIf you have someone coming in with abnormally long lease terms and abnormally high rents, you\u2019re going to make that call\u201d to the tenant, he added.\n\u201cThe fraud part is hard to second-guess,\u201d a rival bridge lender said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the game a long time, and I know it\u2019s really hard to avoid if you have a clever borrower. But I do think at this [loan] size, there should have been more scrutiny.\u201d\nDuring Franklin BSP\u2019s second-quarter earnings call on July 29, commercial real estate investment chief Michael Comparato described the fraud as \u201can isolated criminal incident.\u201d In addition to initiating foreclosure proceedings on the collateral properties and securing a \u201ctemporary freeze\u201d of the borrower\u2019s assets, Benefit Street is working with Walgreens to funnel rent payments directly to the lender, he said \u201cWe have a strong history of credit performance and believe we have a rigorous underwriting process that we are continually looking to enhance,\u201d Comparato said on the call. \u201cThis has been a difficult, unusual and criminal situation and we are keenly focused on maximizing any recoveries.\u201d\nNoting the extent of the fraud, one CRE CLO investor quipped, \u201cYou can make a movie about this case.\u201d The investor also called it \u201ca great learning opportunity\u201d for the commercial mortgage industry, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s fraud, so that\u2019s not great. But it does happen, and they were able to catch it, so maybe they were doing something right.\u201d\nFranklin BSP has taken a $28.4 million write-down on the fraudulent loan, chief executive Richard Byrne said during last week\u2019s earnings call. \u201cThis was an act of fraud that we discovered after determining that the borrower made material misrepresentations in connection with a second pending loan\u201d on different properties, he said \u201cAt that point, it was determined that the borrower had provided the company with approximately 100 falsified and forged documents in connection with the underwriting\u201d of the loan on the Walgreens portfolio, Byrne added. \u201cThis served to materially overstate the actual rents and duration of lease terms for the Walgreen stores. When confronted, the borrower subsequently confessed verbally and in writing to the fraudulent acts.\u201d\nBhai could not be reached for comment.\nByrne cited a loan balance of $113.2 million, which matched the amount provided in the corresponding portion of Franklin BSP\u2019s latest 8-K filing with the SEC. But the total loan amount was actually $149.7 million, according to a lawsuit Benefit Street filed against Bhai and alleged co-conspirators on July 26 in the 160th Civil District Court of Dallas County.\nA total loan size of $149.7 million also was the amount cited in offering documents for a CRE CLO that Benefit Street priced on June 10. The lender securitized $80 million of the debt via that deal (BSPRT 2022-FL9) and funneled another $11.5 million into the collateral pool for one of its previous CLOs (BSPRT 2021-FL6). After the fraud came to light, the lender moved to protect bond buyers by repurchasing that debt from the CLO trusts at par value.\n\u201cIf they didn\u2019t buy it out, their [CLO issuance] program would have been dead,\u201d said an investor in one of the transactions. \u201cThe next time they are out in the market [with a new CLO] they are going to have to explain how this happened.\u201d\n\u201cFraud can happen to anyone, but this is their second big disaster,\u201d a competing bridge lender said, referring to Benefit Street\u2019s long-running battle over a $68 million floater it originated on the Williamsburg Hotel in Brooklyn.\nThe 147-room hotel is owned by an entity that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2021. Benefit Street wrote the loan in 2017 for a partnership controlled by Heritage Equity Partners chief executive Toby Moskovits and president Michael Lichtenstein. The borrower stopped making payments in December 2018, and the extendable bridge loan defaulted at initial maturity the following June. Including accrued interest and fees, the balance is now around $95 million.\nThe borrower lost control of the property about two months ago \u2014 when a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in White Plains, N.Y., noted numerous diversions of hotel cashflows to other investments controlled by Moskovits and Lichtenstein. \u201cAt times, some of those actions also appear to me to rise to the level of fraud,\u201d Judge Robert Drain said. His May 26 decision paved the way for the U.S. Trustee to tap Stephen Gray, of Boston-based Gray & Co., as the hotel\u2019s operating trustee.\nGray\u2019s appointment marked a major victory for Benefit Street, which in 2018 securitized a $57.1 million portion of the Williamsburg Hotel note in one of its CLOs (BSPRT 2018-FL3). It pulled that debt out of the deal the following year.\n\u201cThe property performance has been outstanding, and the Chapter 11 trustee has selected \u2026 brokers and advisors to liquidate the assets through a sale process to be approved by the bankruptcy court,\u201d Comparato said during last week\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe would hope to see positive resolution to this loan within the coming quarters.\u201d",

I had already discovered their web of deceit within my first six months, having been recruited to the company to develop their acquisition program for a supposed REIT they were forming. They owned (or represented they owned) a Hilton Hampton Inn in Addison, TX, as well as several other hotels in the area. It took little time to realize that they only had one hotel under their direct management.\nThe bottom line is that some BIG funds were hurt, but there were also the little guys like me that were talked into investing in their REIT that have now lost the proverbial nested. I have tried to follow this case, and so little information exists on such large-scale fraud. I left in August of 2021 after realizing everything that came from their collective mouths was lies. However, my departure did not come about until I invested a considerable sum in their venture and left with the promise of repaying it. I spoke to their attorneys several times and had a few small payments that came my way after my resignation, but it all stopped. Attorneys had supposedly \"fired\" their client, and I was left with no way to contact anyone to attempt to have my seven-figure investment returned.\nIt left a gap in their narrative when I left them (I am a high-profile, well-respected Hotelier). It appears that they solicited Ken Greene, the former President & CEO of the AAHOA. It seems that he might have been aware of the ensuing fraud but was compensated so well he said nothing until he disappeared from the picture. He altered his LinkedIn, never mentioning that he was the COO and that the company's website had understandably been turned off that had his photo and title.\nI'd love to hear any updates and only wish them jail time :)",

                "contentText": "Analyst 2 in RE - Comm Came across this incredibly interesting story in this week's Commercial Mortgage Alert - apparently some guy altered a bunch of leases & rent rolls for his portfolio of Walgreens and was able to fraudulently overborrow from Benefit Street, who went on to securitize said paper.\nI'm just going to leave the full story below, but curious to know if anyone has more insight here.\n\"Industry pros are abuzz about a fraudulent borrower who induced Benefit Street\nPartners to write a large loan on 24 Walgreens stores in 10 states - with some also\nraising questions about the lender's due-diligence practices.\nBenefit Street, a New York-based unit of Franklin Templeton Investments, originated\nthe $149.7 million mortgage on April 18. A large portion of the debt is now\nheld by Franklin BSP Realty Trust, a public mortgage REIT managed by Benefit\nStreet.\nThe triple-net-leased collateral properties are owned by Raheel \"Ray\" Bhai, the\nchief executive of Addison, Texas-based investment firm IBF Properties, who is\nbeing sued by Benefit Street for fraud.\nSince the REIT disclosed the incident on an earnings call last week, rival bridge\nlenders have marveled over the extent of the fraud. They also have wondered how\nthe lender, which securitized portions of the floating-rate debt via two commercial real estate CLOs, overlooked certain warning signs that seem clear in hindsight.\nCompetitors have focused in particular on the reported rents and lease terms for the collateral properties, which Benefit Street now claims were significantly overstated by the borrower. Noting that many of the properties are in rural areas, one industry veteran said Benefit Street and other commercial real estate professionals who worked on the deal should have suspected they were being overvalued.\n\"If you have someone coming in with abnormally long lease terms and abnormally high rents, you're going to make that call\" to the tenant, he added.\n\"The fraud part is hard to second-guess,\" a rival bridge lender said. \"I've been in the game a long time, and I know it's really hard to avoid if you have a clever borrower. But I do think at this [loan] size, there should have been more scrutiny.\"\nDuring Franklin BSP's second-quarter earnings call on July 29, commercial real estate investment chief Michael Comparato described the fraud as \"an isolated criminal incident.\" In addition to initiating foreclosure proceedings on the collateral properties and securing a \"temporary freeze\" of the borrower's assets, Benefit Street is working with Walgreens to funnel rent payments directly to the lender, he said \"We have a strong history of credit performance and believe we have a rigorous underwriting process that we are continually looking to enhance,\" Comparato said on the call. \"This has been a difficult, unusual and criminal situation and we are keenly focused on maximizing any recoveries.\"\nNoting the extent of the fraud, one CRE CLO investor quipped, \"You can make a movie about this case.\" The investor also called it \"a great learning opportunity\" for the commercial mortgage industry, adding: \"It's fraud, so that's not great. But it does happen, and they were able to catch it, so maybe they were doing something right.\"\nFranklin BSP has taken a $28.4 million write-down on the fraudulent loan, chief executive Richard Byrne said during last week's earnings call. \"This was an act of fraud that we discovered after determining that the borrower made material misrepresentations in connection with a second pending loan\" on different properties, he said \"At that point, it was determined that the borrower had provided the company with approximately 100 falsified and forged documents in connection with the underwriting\" of the loan on the Walgreens portfolio, Byrne added. \"This served to materially overstate the actual rents and duration of lease terms for the Walgreen stores. When confronted, the borrower subsequently confessed verbally and in writing to the fraudulent acts.\"\nBhai could not be reached for comment.\nByrne cited a loan balance of $113.2 million, which matched the amount provided in the corresponding portion of Franklin BSP's latest 8-K filing with the SEC. But the total loan amount was actually $149.7 million, according to a lawsuit Benefit Street filed against Bhai and alleged co-conspirators on July 26 in the 160th Civil District Court of Dallas County.\nA total loan size of $149.7 million also was the amount cited in offering documents for a CRE CLO that Benefit Street priced on June 10. The lender securitized $80 million of the debt via that deal (BSPRT 2022-FL9) and funneled another $11.5 million into the collateral pool for one of its previous CLOs (BSPRT 2021-FL6). After the fraud came to light, the lender moved to protect bond buyers by repurchasing that debt from the CLO trusts at par value.\n\"If they didn't buy it out, their [CLO issuance] program would have been dead,\" said an investor in one of the transactions. \"The next time they are out in the market [with a new CLO] they are going to have to explain how this happened.\"\n\"Fraud can happen to anyone, but this is their second big disaster,\" a competing bridge lender said, referring to Benefit Street's long-running battle over a $68 million floater it originated on the Williamsburg Hotel in Brooklyn.\nThe 147-room hotel is owned by an entity that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2021. Benefit Street wrote the loan in 2017 for a partnership controlled by Heritage Equity Partners chief executive Toby Moskovits and president Michael Lichtenstein. The borrower stopped making payments in December 2018, and the extendable bridge loan defaulted at initial maturity the following June. Including accrued interest and fees, the balance is now around $95 million.\nThe borrower lost control of the property about two months ago - when a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in White Plains, N.Y., noted numerous diversions of hotel cashflows to other investments controlled by Moskovits and Lichtenstein. \"At times, some of those actions also appear to me to rise to the level of fraud,\" Judge Robert Drain said. His May 26 decision paved the way for the U.S. Trustee to tap Stephen Gray, of Boston-based Gray & Co., as the hotel's operating trustee.\nGray's appointment marked a major victory for Benefit Street, which in 2018 securitized a $57.1 million portion of the Williamsburg Hotel note in one of its CLOs (BSPRT 2018-FL3). It pulled that debt out of the deal the following year.\n\"The property performance has been outstanding, and the Chapter 11 trustee has selected \u2026 brokers and advisors to liquidate the assets through a sale process to be approved by the bankruptcy court,\" Comparato said during last week's earnings call. \"We would hope to see positive resolution to this loan within the coming quarters.\"",

It\u2019s definitely not the healthiest culture when you look at it from a 10,000 ft view.\n\nWith that said, there are brokers out there that retire with a 8+ figure net worth cause they were smart with their money. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing brokers wash out here in the coming months, but those that stay can make a lot of money when things pick back up. It\u2019s crazy to me the lifestyle some of these senior guys live, while making $500K+. All while having no skin in the game.\n\nAt the end of the day though, this industry is filled with degenerates.

I'm 4 years into the industry and worked in brokerage at a smaller firm for 2, even in a top city the named brokers in articles are lucky to make $2-300k consistently year over year.\nSeems there's a lot of prestige, but in reality they make very little consistently, have an over importance of what they're doing, and on the middle market side sloppy and unpolished. Look at some of the old Massey Knakal guys/others in that space and how they dress now/general look some come across as slimy/sketchy guys.\nOn drinking, my boss was a huge alcoholic and others in the office asked me to look out for him when we would go to events lol. He had vodka every night, could not be counted on and would go off on trips focusing on his business for weeks at a time. He had family problems as well and was a sketchy guy (whispers in our team that he actually stole money from a deal and he would ask me for money at times).\nOverall some very smart/polished guys at the top, but the majority are sketchy salesman. Even at the top they brag about billions in sales yet on $100mm deal they're lucky to get $500k before a split and taxes and those deals are very rare maybe once even few years for a small handful of guys. It's just surprising how guys can survive with the swings even with established connections, so many guys say they know someone so well or are related yet you see them go with other brokers so seems there's really no loyalty/that doesn't mean much I'm not sure.\nAlso, seems a lot of times even with a good relationship an owner is not using a broker and can easily go direct for deals or potential sales. On the ownership side there can be hundreds of hours of work where you connect solely with owners direct before even engaging a broker so seems the top ones are lucky to even get engaged at times and in those cases the owner can see bids and decide to not move forward. Even if you run a process a broker has no power in anything and would be used for the name (a JLL, CBRE, etc), market information, and internal coverage/making sure all bases are covered to senior leadership (\"we engaged a broker at top firm who went to every viable market participant, these are the offers we received\").",

So, while everyone things a broker should be Don Draper, goofballs connect with goofballs.  Or, put another way, its like actors. Brad Pitt is successful, but so is John C. Reilly. Some character actors are in more movies, or are smarter with their money, than some big name actors. Works the same way. \n- Believe it or not, some people actually don't enjoy (hate?) their family. They maybe got married to appease someone, or look like a family man. Now they realize they just want to engage in debauchery. And to tell the true, a lot of wives know what they signed up for; they're fine to take care of the kids and left their husband work and play golf all the time as long as they have the big house/car and don't have to work themselves. Some are also just addicted to the grind and honestly would almost work for free than be home. I don't know if you want wrestling, but a good example would be Ric Flair, got had a family and stuff but LOVED being on the road. \n- Also, brokerage has some smart people, but its also an industry with low barrier to entry in a sense. Not low barriers to making money, but low barriers to get into it. That's most sales jobs. So the types of people who take those jobs are usually people who aren't the most polished. ",

I know this doesn't answer your question specifically, but I suppose my stance is that other than using 3% regression to the mean number for a 10 year DCF, the only quantitatively realistic measure would be a MC model...",

Therefore, MC simulations attempt to run thousands of iterations within a certain \"parameter\" you set to arrive at a result.\nI wont go into the detail here, but google it and you might be interested in it. I do think it has real applications especially on a 10 yr DCF model.\nNOW, where the real issue lies in my opinion, is what will a buyer model out?. On the acquisitions side, sure these fine tune models can add applicable value to prevent the firm from over-paying. But when you are running a valuation/disposition analysis, you need to employ the metrics that the market/buyer will use. In this case, almost always you'll see a 3% across the board inflation on revenue and expenses...regardless of market or timing. Due to difficultly of modelling 10 yrs of assumptions, on any short-lease type of asset (such as MF, storage, etc), the industry norm is to take a F12 NOI and cap it. Determining market data metrics is much more realistic on a 0-1 yr window...\nHope this helps...",

Not saying thats how you felt but the tone and the way your wrote your comment, it certainly felt that way. In reality, we all know that the stock market and CRE is related even if there is no direct relationship and secondly, you yourself saw how much has changed in a week, so when there is so much happening in a quick period of time, if there is limited data available, it is better to not believe in two extremes-either the world is crashing or everything is fine. The way your worded your comment, it felt like you were in one extreme and even in 08 when the world was crashing, there were people who had their heads in the sand saying everything was fine and it left a bad taste in everyones mouth particularly when the person saying everything was fine had something to gain from it. Not saying you had any nefarious intentions, just offering one perspective on the amount of monkey shit and why someone would not like what you said as it comes off like a person having their head in the sand.",

If prices start to drop and investors begin panic selling, this could create more activity.\nWhat you don\u2019t want is for capital to dry up. Meaning you don\u2019t want lenders to stop lending, LP investors to stop giving operators capital through JVs, Pension Funds to curtail their investment into PE Funds, public REITs to lose their ability to raise debt/equity.\nRight now the only issue I see is public REITs losing their ability to raise equity due to their low stock prices. But again this can create deal flow if the REIT is forced to sell properties in order to pay down debt.\nAnyone have a different take on this? I\u2019m mostly thinking through the lens of the value-add / opportunistic PE fund because this is the field I want to get into",

Many opportunistic funds haven\u2019t been able to find good deals because valuations are so high. If prices start to drop and investors begin panic selling, this could create more activity.\nWhat you don\u2019t want is for capital to dry up. Meaning you don\u2019t want lenders to stop lending, LP investors to stop giving operators capital through JVs, Pension Funds to curtail their investment into PE Funds, public REITs to lose their ability to raise debt/equity.\nRight now the only issue I see is public REITs losing their ability to raise equity due to their low stock prices. But again this can create deal flow if the REIT is forced to sell properties in order to pay down debt.\nAnyone have a different take on this? I\u2019m mostly thinking through the lens of the value-add / opportunistic PE fund because this is the field I want to get into\nThe thing about market downturns is they aren't just a momentary hard reset of asset valuations followed by another 7 year run-up. You don't just get to buy something at half-price one day and then enjoy robust income growth into perpetuity. There are years and years of negative growth.\nExample:After the dot com bubble of 2000 the S&P didn't return to previous highs until roughly 2007 (then it fell off a fucking cliff again). It didn't even start to recover until 2003. Most PE funds don't have a 7 year horizon to wait until pricing recovers. Most models I build don't work with 3-5years worth of negative growth assumptions.",

Perhaps I'm missing something, but under your example, someone who bought in early 2002 when the S&P was at 1,172 and sold in early 2007 at 1,409 would have enjoyed reasonable returns, even accounting for the fact that the S&P dipped below 900 at one point. Am I thinking about this in the wrong manner? Understood that perhaps the 4% appreciation plus whatever dividends on top isn't making a fund manager rich, but it's certainly upside. To say that the market didn't reach it's previous high to til 2007 ignores the fact that we're discussing investing in the aftermath of a correction, not before.",

Generally, think of real estate more as a marathon and public markets as a sprint. You won't feel the volatility in real estate in the same sense so it's kind of inefficient to compare them the same way. Financial markets react immediately to both rational and irrational behavior, and that becomes compounded during times of near term uncertainty. Real estate doesn't work that way and it takes a lot more time to turn the ship around, which means we are somewhat shielded from the corrections and volatility the market is experiencing right now.\nDoes that mean we are immune to a headwinds?

                "contentText": "Speaking from the principal perspective here.\nTangential to the question, but I'm having a different perspective on the covid impact on real estate.\nWhile recently raised funds or funds with significant dry powder may be well positioned to capitalize on value opportunities from distressed sales etc, and that historically, the inverse correlation with equities would suggest that people would gravitate toward RE in times like these, I think there will certainly be significant headwinds to the office RE space (and hospitality) in the next few quarters.\nBuildings that we've been prepping for the market have all been sidelined. Nobody's touring nowadays, so no point in marketing a property if you're going to get a fraction of interested buyers. I know for our fund there will likely be a freeze on all investment activity for at least the near term, and I can't imagine too many other buyers making purchases at a time like this.\nAnd that's not even touching upon the impacts on capital markets. I'd be surprised how many of the traditional lenders are willing to make loans now.\nAside from new investment activity, existing portfolios are going to suffer as well. As the entire country gradually comes under the restraints of 'lockdown' and employers are forcing employees to WFH, I imagine there will be little to no leasing activity for the next few quarters. Who's going to sign a large expensive lease when >50% of your workers are going to be remote? And let's not forget our friends at WeWork in all of this. Boy have they just hopped out of the frying pan and into the fire... they just can't catch a break. Our AM's are walking these wework spaces and seeing entire floors just barren. I can't imagine any short term leasing to be done at WeWork esp considering they have the highest density spaces possible so they've gotta be hemorrhaging cash. Would Softbank's investors even allow another bailout at this point?\nTo the point of real estate being more of a marathon and not a race, I'd think this is true for long-term hold funds, at least for the Boston Properties of the world out there who are likely in a fine position to weather this.

Once the COVID-19 curve has \"flattened\" (2 weeks, 2 months? how long do we need to lockdown is the question), I imagine people will slowly go back to working from their offices, getting their nails done, consuming, etc. while remaining cautious. In short, i think consumer confidence will spike back quickly.\nIn the RE world, most owners who did not over-lever should be able to weather a freeze in activity - again assuming it only lasts for a month or so. RE institutional fund performance is relative to peers. We are all going through this so your 5-year 15% projected IRR might be a 12% IRR, but so will everyone else.

Just remember that it will pass and you'll find a great opportunity at some point in the near future. Imagine graduating in 2008...RE guys were SOL for almost 2 years. Everything I've read indicates that this recovery will be quicker. There is still ample dry powder in the market so transaction volume and hiring will pick up when the dust settles, hopefully in a few months.",

So we're either firing people or about to fire people.\nBased on my personal communications, I'd say it's about 10% Camp A, 80% Camp B, and 10% Camp C. With things potentially trending toward Camp C if it keeps getting worse. Although, the one positive thing I've seen out of this situation is that people are more responsive, so it's been easier to make connections and gather information.\nGood luck everybody!",

However, I think that the skill set earned at ORIX would probably leave a lot of holes if you are looking to transition into the equity side of the business. While you would learn value-add, elements of construction and various markets/fundamentals, you would come out lacking full understanding when it comes to development and structuring the equity side of the business (waterfalls etc.).\nIf you are interested in doing JVs in the future, the best path would be to lateral to a larger shop with an equity team and then lateral your way onto the equity team (ex. ORIX Analyst-> NYL debt associate -> NYL equity associate).",

One team may reserve equity for Associates and above while another team may only allocate equity to Managing Directors and above.\nFor various reasons, Hines is moving towards a more centralized organizational structure.  While the decentralized organizational structure has served the partnership well historically, the executive leadership is moving towards a more institutional focused firm.  Thus, the compensation structure is changing and becoming more uniform and in line with general industry norms and across the organization itself.\nI can't comment to specific numbers.  I expect base plus incentive compensation has increased across the organization, but equity opportunities have meaningfully decreased.  That's about all I can share with confidence.",

                "contentText": "I've been wondering about MSREI myself, and you're right that WSO is weak on info. This is all rumored so I'm open to correction\u2026 but from what I hear it's hard to complain about MSREI comp, hours, or culture. AN1 base is ~110K and bonus is flat 70%. AN2 has a 15-20% increase in base and a variable bonus in the 30-90% range. Not sure about AS1/AS2+, but you can hypothesize based on other firms with similar AN comp levels. There are ~15 people in LA, ~20 in SF, and ~40 in NY. Culture (at least in SF/LA) is not banking hardo at all. If you're doing your job right, I doubt anyone would yell at you for no reason. But like all firms, interns and analysts have some leniency with mistakes if they're trying their best, associates get yelled at by VPs, VPs get yelled at by MDs, and MDs get yelled at by LPs. What can you do, we're a rather loud country. MS also has some of the best perks out of any financial institution. With regards to hours, the west coast offices have analysts working about 12 hours per day until tough parts of the deal cycle come up. In which case, you'll occasionally work weekends and may have some 16+ hour days here and there but never for more than a few days at a time. Plus, you will get the occasional free afternoon if there's a lull. I assume that at the NY office those longer days come up a bit more often. But unlike elite boutiques that will have you working those 100+ hour weeks regularly, MSREI is definitely a bit more relaxed (which is representative of REPE as a whole). Also there's such a rich RE history at MSREI and MSREIB because they've been around since the dawn of time. Overall, I'd say it's an excellent place to be as an associate. With all the BX circle jerking on WSO, people forget to comment on other great shops. So if anyone has something to add here, please do.",

One team may reserve equity for Associates and above while another team may only allocate equity to Managing Directors and above.\nFor various reasons, Hines is moving towards a more centralized organizational structure.  While the decentralized organizational structure has served the partnership well historically, the executive leadership is moving towards a more institutional focused firm.  Thus, the compensation structure is changing and becoming more uniform and in line with general industry norms and across the organization itself.\nI can't comment to specific numbers.  I expect base plus incentive compensation has increased across the organization, but equity opportunities have meaningfully decreased.  That's about all I can share with confidence.",

AN2 has a 15-20% increase in base and a variable bonus in the 30-90% range. Not sure about AS1/AS2+, but you can hypothesize based on other firms with similar AN comp levels. There are ~15 people in LA, ~20 in SF, and ~40 in NY. Culture (at least in SF/LA) is not banking hardo at all. If you're doing your job right, I doubt anyone would yell at you for no reason. But like all firms, interns and analysts have some leniency with mistakes if they're trying their best, associates get yelled at by VPs, VPs get yelled at by MDs, and MDs get yelled at by LPs. What can you do, we're a rather loud country. MS also has some of the best perks out of any financial institution. With regards to hours, the west coast offices have analysts working about 12 hours per day until tough parts of the deal cycle come up. In which case, you'll occasionally work weekends and may have some 16+ hour days here and there but never for more than a few days at a time. Plus, you will get the occasional free afternoon if there's a lull. I assume that at the NY office those longer days come up a bit more often. But unlike elite boutiques that will have you working those 100+ hour weeks regularly, MSREI is definitely a bit more relaxed (which is representative of REPE as a whole). Also there's such a rich RE history at MSREI and MSREIB because they've been around since the dawn of time. Overall, I'd say it's an excellent place to be as an associate. With all the BX circle jerking on WSO, people forget to comment on other great shops. So if anyone has something to add here, please do.",

You're not \"just doing property management\" you're \"managing a $XX million business.,\" etc. etc.\nThere's a natural transition from property management to asset management, so that's an obvious option. From there, you could work your way into real estate private equity. I would also highly advise networking your ass off. That is by far the best way to switch.",

Salesforce is sort of a static repository, meaning its basically an online filing cabinet. So if you have a bunch of people using the data base but don't update things in a uniform manner, it can make your reporting a bit funky and inaccurate.. Which can be frustrating when you need to produce a report in a pinch. This happened to me when I was at my old employer, we had switched the structure that we used to manage 'contacts' and 'opportunities' and some of the older employees were resistant to changing how they input data such as comments pertaining to discussions, changes to loan amounts, etc.\nDoesn't sound like a big deal but when its for hundreds of loans that go back a few years and you need to manage reporting, you'll export to excel and have to do a bunch of manual work shifting cells around, which sucks. Depending on where you work, this may not be a big deal but our reports went to regulators so it created a lot of headache for us\nI was in tech sales prior to lending so I knew Salesforce inside out. Naturally I got put on all reporting tasks after that, which was less than ideal.\nBest way to do this efficiently is take an afternoon with everyone involved and think through your process when you begin to implement the system, agree on a workflow and stick to it",

The output reports are very easy to customize and create. Cons are the scheduling/Gantt chart feature is a waste of time unless you have only a few Milestone tasks like acquisition date, deposit date, contingency financing date, etc. It's not a project management software like it claims to be unless you have an admin that can spend all day updating dates and dependencies. You'd be better off with MS Project Cloud if you want something online for scheduling and assigning tasks.",

Leads to yeild chasing in massive malinvestment projects, and most critically causes banks to hord all of the quality collateral.  \nThe real risk however comes from the lack of clarity on who actually owns the collateral.  I am no expert but it wouldn't shock me if something like 70 - 75% of all of the \"base collateral\" used in global finance is merely phantom collateral.  An example would be a treasury bond.  If you are bank 1 in the chain and you own the treasury itself you then create a derivative product and that lands in bank 2 then bank 3, bank 4, etc. etc.  Now if that was all that was happening it is technically possible to unwind the string and get back to the base asset.  The issue is that these collateral items have been used to create counter risk products, underwrite contracts, etc. etc.  All of these items claim to have a claim to said asset.  How does one litigate that when the same collateral has been used in say a SLBC, and the insurance product underwriting the SBLC itself?  Who gets paid? The firm that holds the SBLC or the reinsurance company who underwrote the SBLC? It is estiamted that the claims on dollars vs the actual dollars themselves can be levered up into the low 5 figure range.  So say for example you have $1B in \"dollars\" the derivative claims could be as high as $10T+.  If that house of cards starts to unravel the bottom of the hole will never be discovered. \nIf you want to learn more about this start with something called the \"eurodollar\".  It is a wild story and believed by me and others to be the actually cause of the current global economic woes that have plagued the economy since 2008.",

This happened to SVB, to First Republic, to Signature Bank... major financial institutions.\nAnd by what definition do you say we're already in a recession?  Also, depending on that definition, why does it matter?  If jobs numbers and wage growth stays strong, and inflation comes in, then there won't be a major issue, because consumer spending will stay strong.  So far all of those things are true, which is why you see more and more predictions of a soft landing.\nAlso, a short recession wouldn't be the worst thing in slowing down a massively overheated economy.  Trump's outrageous tax cuts followed by outrageous amounts of stimulus money led to insane valuations in pretty much every corner of the market - creating a small puncture to let the air out of that now, rather than risk waiting for a massive blowup, is arguably a good thing.",

Lending standards were so lax that you'd see 100% LTV loans, just on the assumption there would be 20-30% appreciation.  Not saying you can't lever up your capital stack, but that kind of shoot from the hip lending doesn't exist in the same way.

If the labor market turns, it will be pretty hard to avoid a recession (using the technical definition) by the end of the year. If you talk to some businesses, they would say we already there. I think some are confusing stock market resilience driven by megacap tech with economic resilience. The YTD QQQ performance has largely been driven by multiple expansion and not strong growth. For example, even though Apple stock is up big YTD, it just announced a YOY revenue decline of -3% and even larger declines in Macbooks.

I don't know to what degree bank lending drives the economy, but it's a simple math problem--banks can't grow their loan portfolios anymore with deposit runoff as there isn't the cash to fund loan growth. So, if a recession is just slight negative GDP growth, you don't need catastrophic trends to bend the economy into negative territory.

Banks had huge loan growth in 2022 with noticeable deposit runoff, and slower but still decent loan growth in Q1 of 2023. I don't know to what degree bank lending drives the economy, but it's a simple math problem--banks can't grow their loan portfolios anymore with deposit runoff as there isn't the cash to fund loan growth. So, if a recession is just slight negative GDP growth, you don't need catastrophic trends to bend the economy into negative territory. This will probably have a notable capital investment impact, particularly in states that have seen strong growth recently (e.g., Georgia, Florida, Texas).    \n100% this. my bank has already relayed the message that we need to shrink the balance sheet for this exact reason. We are declining deals left and right based on returns not hurdling. If you can get credit, you're going to pay up for it one way or another (deposits, significant increase in fees, spread increases, etc.) ",

Well they revised the numbers for March by like 150k (350k reported in march, beating 330K expectations.) It was revised down to 180(!!!!)K.\nI've been bearish for awhile because of a number of macro factors underlying the system. However I'll be honest that I initially wrote-off the SVB and Signature Bank failures as just mismanagement. It's clear now that this problem is not going away. Just the banking system alone could pull this down (Anonymous Director of Private Credit hit on it too). I'm not even going to touch on other possibly systemic problems (wave of refinancings, unknown and hard-to-quantify credit risks in private equity and private lending, etc.)\nExplain this argument:\n1/3 of American workers are employed by businesses with under 100 employees. 1/2 of American workers are employed by businesses with under 500 employees. \nLarge banks don't lend to these size businesses -- they dont understand local markets and the economics frankly isnt worth it for them\nIn their place, community banks and credit unions extend credit. That's why, for example commercial real estate credits seem disproportionately  held by regional banks -- they understand the markets that GSIB banks dont\nRegional banks have deposit interest of sub-100 basis points (pick your exact number, it's low no matter what you pick)\nThe rational thing for people to do is take their money out of their local banks and put it in RISK-FREE treasury assets earning 4.5-5.0% or money market accounts. It's exactly what's happening - regional lenders are having massive outflows\nKeep in mind that regional banks can't really raise their deposit interest to match treasury yields because they have loans from the past 10 years of free money that are only yielding 3%.\nNow the regional banks are in a position where: (A) they are having outflows which limits their ability to extend credit even for creditworthy borrowers, and (B) their NIM is going to get absolutely nuked by the yields on their loan book\nNow more regional banks start failing, and capital that would've been extended through credit to localities for starting new small businesses, building new buildings, etc.  isn't there.\nThe fallout from that just spreads -- e.g. the construction worker that would've been paid to build that new building now foregoes a coffee at the coffee shop, and that owner is forced to cut labor... and the chain of events continues.\nI don't want to spread doom and gloom to cause panic, this is just genuinely how I see it. We've gone from ZIRP to 5% rates in a year. The wave of refinancings is going to destroy asset prices across real estate, public equity, private debt, corporate debt, high yield...\nWe're going to hit that brick wall at 100mph. Would really like for someone to point out where I'm wrong.",

Because there's so much uncertainty of outcomes, it feels like the only thing I can do is go overweight cash until after the dust settles.\nThe problem with this situation is that once markets acknowledge the economic gravity of the environment, people begin panicking, behaving irrationally, letting emotions get involved -- everything that follows is path dependent on whatever the latest thing to break was. Albeit made by Karl Marx, there is truth to the quote: \"There are decades where nothing happens, and weeks where decades happen.\" If I had to make some high probability guesses:\nPublic market volatility\nI think active management will return in vogue as managers can be more nimble than passive investors and capitalize on moves higher or lower\nThe March 2020 crash was unusual because the equity markets puked their guts out in about 2-3 weeks. Look back at previous downturns and you'll see it can take anywhere from 6 to 24 months of fake rallies and subsequent crashes before the bottom. That's all opportunity for alpha in riding waves as markets whipsaw\nIlliquid assets take a valuation hit\nYou're already seeing this happen in real estate as investors find they cant work with creditors to refinance. See Green Street and Blackrock handing the keys over to creditors in March and April\nOn the private equity side, GPs (and LPs) might be tempted to extend fund lives merely to survive this period until low rates are re-instated. That might not be an option for everyone, however, it's their best hope -- no one wants to mark down their book unless they can't avoid it.\nForced sellers obviously create incredible opportunities, but investors can no longer bank on flat multiples / cap rates at exit, let alone multiple expansion or reduced cap rates. What this means is that investors will likely be focused on only the highest quality assets that you can be sure will have value throughout and beyond a downturn\nArtificial Intelligence\nI'm not one to buy into hype, but one can't ignore the implications of the demonstrable utility of AI in the past few months alone. As corporations restructure throughout the downturn, many will look into AI to permanently reduce headcount. If you can get exposure to the legit AI companies at a decent valuation I think you'd be stupid not to \nAn overarching flight to value\nI'd have to think more about what other golden opportunities could arise, but these were the ones that came to me off-the-cuff. \nOne caveat -- and there's always a caveat -- is how the Fed responds and their policy timing. Despite that they've already set in motion much of this to happen, if they, for example, took interest rates back down to 0% TOMORROW, this crisis probably doesn't play out. But if they are serious about \"higher for longer\" (and there are good reasons to doubt this given an upcoming election year), you'd better buckle up because things could look a lot different in a year or two than they do today.\n\"...And once the storm is over, you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in.

                "postContent": "Envisioned a thread that discusses all things solar. Kind of like a Lunch and Learn. There was a thread like this for LIHTC and learned a lot from it. Looking forward to educate others on solar and learn what other CRE professionals know/are doing with their portfolios. I can kick it off.\nWork at a multifamily developer that has bought and installed 6 solar systems on new developments over the past decade. We own about 60 properties so 10% of our portfolio has solar. We are examining adding solar to more of our existing properties. Most of the properties are affordable LIHTC, one community center, one market-rate multifamily. Here are the basic advantages and disadvantages as I see it.\nAdvantages \nAt a high level, over the long run solar pays for itself. Solar can pay for itself over 4-5 years. We installed a system in 2012 that has paid for itself 2.5x. The high upfront installation costs are offset by these 3 main variables: \nElectrical savings- This is arguably the main benefit. The generation of solar power directly offsets the electricity bill. We find solar power offsets anywhere from 40-60% of our electricity bill annually depending on the property. The cost of electricity is going up and will continue to go up. We used to pay around $.12 per KW a few years ago now we're paying around $.17 per KW. \nFederal Solar Tax Credits- By installing solar panels, the property owner can claim a 30% dollar for dollar tax credit that goes against installation costs. The credit is boosted to 40% if enough of the equipment is produced domestically (this is not easy to obtain). \nSolar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) Income (state dependent)- Many states have issued aggressive energy goals for their Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). An example would be X% of electricity must be solar generated. Some states have created a market for these renewable energy credits that power companies must buy according to law. There is a price per credit that is market dependent. We happen to own property in DC which has the highest price per credit. SREC Income brings in an additional $15k-$50k per year depending on the solar array size of the property. \nAlso for the LIHTC properties, we can put solar installation costs in basis and generate more LIHTC equity. \nDisadvantages\nUpfront installation costs- Installation is very expensive. You got to really commit to it. Its also a huge time investment working with the solar companies. Delays, change orders, and set up issues are common just like developing a new building. It's another thing for PMs to manage on top of everything else. \nWeather dependent/property dependent- Nobody really knows how much solar power a system will generate on your specific property until the system is installed (after you spent the large upfront investment!). These solar companies have engineers that look at all the property level factors, but take it with a grain of salt. Solar panel technology has improved tremendously over the past decade, but our oldest solar system is the most efficient/best producing because its roof has the perfect storm of good solar generating qualities. We made a line chart KW production for each of the 4 properties with a few years of operating data, and not one was a straight line. \nMaintenance- One thing that is not highlighted is the hidden maintenance costs. Panels need to be cleaned and monitored. Inverters (convert DC power to AC power) eventually break. If you own your own system, solar companies want nothing to do with maintaining it. You need to monitor the power tracking portal regularly. For example, we had a bullet hole in a few of our solar panels at one property that caused the system to massively underproduce. We didn't realize something was wrong until 4 months after because no one logged in the tracking portal or went on the roof of the property. \n\nFeel free to add to advantages/disadvantages if I missed anything.

Couple additional questions if you have the time.\nI have read that the Infrastructure Bill is giving additional credits for installing solar, is that true?\nHow has the improvement in battery technology impacted the economics of installing solar, and relatedly, is it advancing/has it advanced enough to the point where we might see some projects become self-sufficient?  I had always been told that in many places, the generation over the course of a year is enough to power a building, but storing that power overnight or through a succession of cloudy days meant you couldn't get true energy independence from the grid.\nAnd related to the last point, how does the viability of these projects differ in markets where you have the opportunity to sell excess power back to the grid (I know this is possible in NYC)?\nThanks!",

Only for new construction. You need to meet Energy Star requirements to obtain the credit, which has different set of standards than LEED. \nThough battery technology has improved, I think we're far away from independence from the grid. I can't speak much to the impact of how improved battery technology has potentially improved the economics. I think a properties natural sunlight exposure plays a big factor and while technology can help mitigate a lack of exposure, it doesn't completely offset. \nWe look at selling excess power as extra gravy. We have the ability at some of our properties to do this but look at the electrical savings and receiving tax credits as the main selling points that make solar viable for us.  ",

Time of use rates are coming and will generally make solar even more affordable as solar is strongest during the peak of the day (in summer at least). If these rates are effective, they should shift consumer behavior but I am skeptical.\n2. Net metering laws/rules can have a big impact, especially if you are going with a large solar system that has the potential to generate more power than is used by the site. For the markets i know well, these rules are settled and FERC made rulings that were generally in favor of on-site solar but there's always some nuisance to be aware of depending on the state/utility/market.\nAll these general comments are not helpful, especially to RE people. \n  where are TOU rates coming?

Typically REITs love to talk in terms of yield on cost, and companies see yield on cost for solar investment ranging from 10% to 15% (in Europe so elevated power prices assumed for first few years of CF), however if you account for the depreciation the IRR is more like 8% unlevered. Still a great return but if the useful life is only 20 years and if that means a full replacement is needed (both uncertain) then an investor has to keep in mind the future capex liability.\nIt's probably more relevant when thinking about buying assets with solar already installed - great to have the extra income but is there a hidden future cost.\nGoing off piste now but I invest across both real estate and infra and I have spent a long time trying to work out where is best to invest a $ in the whole value chain of renewable energy to make the best risk adjusted return.\nI have ended on the most boring part - electricity grid companies. The sheer scale of capex required to allow for so many connections to the grid and the efficient monetisation of excess power means grid systems globally have to be completely overhauled. It's a necessity. Returns are regulated, yes, but the volume of investment needed keeps on increasing. Grid companies present a great through the cycle capex story, buy and leave for 10 years.

We\u2019re even planning all future projects to be Passive House certified. Since you\u2019re a LIHTC developer I\u2019ll talk specifics here\u2026we\u2019re evaluating the idea of paying all utilities for residents instead of deducting Utility Allowances since a Passive House certified building results in lower energy usage.\nFor those who aren\u2019t familiar with this\u2026\nIn the LIHTC world, the maximum allowable net rent is 60% Area Median Income minus a Utility Allowance that is usually released by the state/administering agency. So rent for a 1 BR unit could be $1,300 (60% AMI) - $200 (1 BR UA) = $1,100. The residents would then pay their own utilities and the idea is that the $200 is an estimate of what it would cost them. Another option for the developer is to charge the full $1,300 and pay all of the resident utilities themselves. In the past we\u2019ve always deducted UAs and had the residents pay for their own utilities, it\u2019s easier to project cash flow. But the introduction of Passive House certified developments has caused us to re-evaluate this. And the Solar panels certainly help as well.\nCurious as to if anyone on this thread has done something similar?",

It seems like the design elements required for passive house, such as strong insulation, would make the job quite a bit expensive. \nThat's an interesting idea on utility allowances. We always do independent utility study over the standard requirements to lower the utility allowances. Getting rid of utility allowances all together would have a huge impact.

                "contentText": "Thought I'd add some useful context I recently received as someone with zero knowledge in the space. I work for operator who's looking at installing solar at one of our office projects and was given the high-level breakdown of how it generally works for the solar companies. The last bullet refers to a question I had on where an office operator sees any sort of ROI from a solar company coming in and marginally reducing an already reimbursable expense. The answer was through roof rent.\nSolar investors spend their time searching for land or buildings owned by third parties  where they can install new solar PVs\nGenerally, the solar investor prefers existing buildings vs. raw land for installations because the existing building is a built-in customer for the solar produced on-site.  Without the built-in customer, the solar investor is stuck selling the power produced on-site to the grid, and since the utility company sets the price of power that it buys for the grid, this isn\u2019t very profitable for the solar investor.\nOn the other hand, an existing building owned by a third-party landlord is a built-in customer for the power generated by the PVs.  Think of it this way \u2013 before solar, the building was buying 100% of its energy consumption from the grid, but after solar, the building will buy the first 25% of its energy needs from the solar PVs, and all remaining energy needs will purchased from the grid.  Overall, the property consumes the same amount of energy, but demand on the grid is 25% lower than before / 25% of power consumed on-site is produced by renewable sources.  Note, this is why demand charges from the utility company for peak consumption periods usually decrease significantly after solar is installed \u2013 the building\u2019s baseline consumption from the grid goes down by the amount of energy now purchased from the on-site PVs.  \nThe typical contract structure b/w the building owner and the solar investor is a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) where the building owner buys the solar produced on-site according to a fixed pricing schedule (w/ usually 2-3% built-in annual escalators) for 15-25 years.  In other words, the solar investor gets a guaranteed, no risk revenue stream for 15-25 years and the building owner has guaranteed power supply for 15-25 years (as well as a corresponding fixed payment obligation, the PPA payment).\nHigh level, the solar business is essentially the same as the real estate business: there are large upfront capital costs to build a structure, but thereafter, the on-going expenses are mainly (1) the cost of capital used for the large upfront capital investment, (2) on-going maintenance expenditures, and (3) depreciation.  Also like real estate, solar investors generate revenue from long-term, fixed-rate contracts (a PPA is very similar to a lease, except the buyer is buying energy instead of the right to occupy a space). \nRhetorical question that will help you understand why roof rent makes sense \u2013 if you were a land owner and a developer came to you saying they secured a pre-lease for a BTS and want to use your land to build the building \u2013 would you allow the developer the long-term use of your property for $0 ground rent?",

                "contentText": "I'm curious about how landlords deal with in-place tenants who had their base year set prior to installing solar. Every situation's unique, depending on lease terms, economics, and so on, but here's an example: Say a tenant's base year is $100K, with $30K going to electricity. If solar cuts electricity costs by $30K, then tenant will likely not owe any additional rent for increases in expenses above their base year. Is that the expectation? Seems like the base year would need to be revised to reflect a typical operating year with solar, but I haven't seen many leases with language that would allow for us. Most leases would allow for the cost to be amortized, so maybe that is enough to increase total operating expenses in comparison years to be above the base year amount. Any insight on how this is typically handled or do landlords just take the reduction in opex and reset base years as they roll?",

                "contentText": "Got it. I only have experience with solar on multifamily, but I would assume for a commercial building that base year would be recalculated. Couldn't imagine lowering electricity cost as a landlord and charging a tenant based on old higher electricity bills. \nIn terms of a landlords cost/benefit analysis to installing solar on a property- if tenant(s) are paying for most/all of electricity cost, the benefit of solar is lower. There are still benefits as an owner- the 30%+ tax credit, being environmentally conscious, and earning SRECs (in our market), but we mainly prioritize installing solar on all our new developments, plus older master metered resi buildings where we pay all of electricity. Our older retail properties have not been prioritized for retrofit because they are all on NNN leases where electricity gets passed through to tenant. ",

Guessing most of you all in the multifamily sector have heard of these folks, company named after the founder Pat Carroll.  Not really sure what his background is, but seems to be a younger guy who just started the firm in the past 5-7 years and has already completed over $5B in total acquisitions.  Seems fucking insane.  Anyone have any insight into these guys, how the fuck they did it and so quickly?  \nThere are other similar companies formed in the past 5-10 years out there doing 200+ unit deals (Tide Equities, Magnolia Capital, GELT, etc) and I am perhaps just ignorant or naive as to how they are capitalizing these deals, or if they are perhaps simply sliver equity sponsors trying to scale and make money in fees, mgmt, etc?

These guys will partner with an larger LP group who will come in with $8-9mm, and they have a network of friends and family to fund their GP piece. Of course, they themselves will have to put in a few hundred thousands dollars each.

Ignoring exit opps and all that garbage, what do you think would be more fun?

Fixed expenses are what one would think... they are fixed no matter if you have 1 tenant in the building or 100. These are expenses the landlord will pay that DO NOT vary with occupancy. these fixed expenses are things like real estate taxes and insurance. Variable are expenses that vary with occupancy, such as utilities & janitorial.\nWhen constructing an argus model, there really isn't a way to determine what % of an expense is variable (unless you have historical actuals and can run analyses on the side). However, industry standard is somewhere between 80/20 - 70/30 for variable / fixed % breakout.\nFor example, let's say you are looking at buying a building that historically has had a occupancy of 50% and last year's utilities ran at $100k per year. We will assume this expense is 20% fixed & 80% variable. For projections in your underwriting, you would need to determine a \"gross up\" amount to enter into the argus model, so when argus does the behind the scene calculation, your utilities net to $100k. The amount you enter into argus is determined by the following formula:\n100,000 = x [fixed % + (occupancy x (1 - fixed %)] 100,000 = x [ .2 + (.5 x .8)] 100,000 = x [ .2 + .4] 100,000 = .6x x= $166,666.67\nNow that we know x, you (ie. ARGUS) can back into whatever your utilities are estimated to be based on your projection of occupancy.",

Primarily worked with the Strategy & Corp Dev teams for the consumer side of the bank during that time. Then left for a fintech startup in a product strategy & analytics role (basically product manager duties), which was acquired shortly after I joined.\nGot bored there after a year so started looking and began interviewing at the MBB firms and doing GMAT prep when this opportunity landed in my lap. I had a bit of a unique background in a few ways that helped me land the role, so I took the chance and joined. Was a very large paycut at first, but 13mo in I have no regrets and don't see myself wanting to leave anytime soon. ",

I currently work on the CRE debt side for a bank (2 years) and have realized that my strengths may lie more towards transacting with people and developing relationships versus, say the technical analysis/underwriting/evaluating that goes along with commercial real estate. I realize banks have roles which encompass these personality skills (loan originators) but I think I would be able to really maximize my value in other areas. Some sort of broker (sales, mortgage) comes to mind, but I fear the volatility of the market and ups & downs of that kind of job.\nDoes working my way into some kind of investor relations role at fund or firm sound like a good alternative? Something that incorporates capital markets, and supports a firm's capital raising efforts, yet has some stability of a base salary and bonus potential based on well one can raise funds? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.",

Seems to typically be a tool of permanent capital for the handful of CTL deals I've seen. \nIf you want exposure on the equity side you should probably look to the STNL space as both of those attributes are pretty much prerequisites for a CTL loan.

None of it justifies my shitty grade, but hoping the color can help with some insight.\nThat said, is my 2.8 gpa going to be the end of my career? Is there anything I can do to salvage the situation? I considered going back to grad school, but it's not financially feasible plus my gpa is probably hopeless. \nEdit: My major gpa is around 3.3",

The people you would work under/learn from, early on in your career would build both a great foundation and relationships within the industry. So whether you decided to stay and make your career there, leave for another firm, or do something more entrepreneurial you should be prepared to do that.\nI will note they are more LP capital, so if you are looking to have an on the ground asset management role, this may not be the best fit. That being said looking at good deals and underwriting, looking at JVA's from the LP perspective can provide good insight in a GP Equity role.\nThat being said I have never worked there and only have this from working alongside this firm. So if someone else can provide greater insight, or can personally dismiss this that would be beneficial.",

I make 25% more in brokerage as an analyst. I thought REPE would be a natural step up as it\u2019s buyside compared to the sell side role of brokerage.\nIs Harrison Street an outlier? REPEs of similar size (and even smaller) in NYC look like they pay double.\nLastly, I interviewed with a very small boutique (less than 50 people) REPE firm in Chicago back in late 2021 and they were paying somewhere between $120k-$150k all in for an acq associate. I\u2019m hoping Harrison street is an outlier but please share your opinions.",

That upfront fee buys the borrower protection, through payments from the originator of the cap if the interest rate goes above X. It's as simple as you pay a fee so that your interest rate risk is capped at a specified number.\nBy selling a floor, the borrower receives a payment upfront. Receiving cash sets a limit, Y, which is the lowest the borrower's interest rate can go.\nThis reduces the range of interest rates under the facility to Y-X.

For the past several months, bridge loans have been the dominant structure with low rates and higher leverage.  However, that seems to be changing.  We are seeing bridge spreads widen significantly and many bridge lenders have largely pulled out of the market.  And with SOFR expected to exceed 3.25% by year-end, most bridge loans will have rates approaching 7% (or higher) in the near future.\nBy contrast, full-leverage Agency fixed rates have stabilized in the 4.75% to 5.25% range, depending on the amount of affordability at the property.  Both Fannie and Freddie have implemented some underwriting changes to try to push loan proceeds higher \u2013 either with extended amortization periods or lower DSCR requirements \u2013 for deals with significant affordability at 80% of AMI. \nAdditionally, Agency floating rate spreads remain in the low 200s for deals where prepayment flexibility is of utmost importance. The cost of SOFR caps has increased and will be a more significant cost in that equation.  We are definitely seeing increased demand for floating rate loans primarily because of the desire for prepayment flexibility.\nAs we prepare for the normal end-of-year run, Agency financing will continue to be a stable and important option for multifamily finance.",

Fundraise is solid, but not spectacular compared to headlines coming out of other firms this past year. Does Hines plan to become a big player in the space? What does volume look like for next year? What % of equity is Hines and will they invest in non-Hines sponsors? Their website explicitly says they do value add in Europe, will they do it in America?\nif you feel more comfortable PMing me please do so",

Anyone who can't be bothered to proofread the boilerplate nonsense that goes on their website probably doesn't have the organizational ability or focus on detail to successfully run a real estate business.\nI am also always skeptical of newer companies (or smaller ones) that claim to be generalists both in scope of asset class and geography.  If you're the size of a Related or a Hines or whatever, then yeah you can make that work.  A 20 person company cannot possibly be executing to a best possible outcomes on industrial buildings in St Louis and office in Houston and multifamily in Florida, all at once.  Pick a lane.  Because otherwise there is always someone who knows more than you do about the market or the asset, and if they're all passing, you are overpaying.",

Some deals hit, some miss. But they keep raising capital. \nWell you notice how your description of them went from \"successful\" to \"they do just fine\" to \"they keep raising capital.\"  Which in my book is a pretty vast gulf.  Just because they keep moving doesn't mean they're doing particularly well - it's been hard to lose money in this business the last ten years.  Are they outperforming their peers?  That's the real question.\nI ask this of all my colleagues who want to do something on their own - what do they have that any other person in this industry doesn't?  What is their edge.  Strong local relationships is one.  Unique knowledge in a field is another.  Merely having money isn't enough anymore.  Every time I hear someone (or heard, you don't hear it anymore as much) say they're going to do value add multifamily in the Southeast or in the Sun Belt I snort.  I've said this before, but there are only so many times you can pick over those assets before someone gets caught without a chair when the music stops.  The Arch guys have been in business for 4 years - how can anyone possibly know if they're successful?  Even in an aggressive timeline they've barely had time to execute on and get out of their business strategy, on just the first few deals!  They say they own ~$350mm in real estate, and that's great.  And if they make a 10% return, that is a \"success\" but it's nothing to write home about when their peers are doing 200-300 bps better.  I just think it's important to differentiate between \"they deployed a lot of money\" and \"they were very successful.\"  The second proposition relies on the first, but by no means is the reverse true.",

                "postContent": "Hello Guys,\nI have been at my current firm for a little over a year now. It's a small development shop based on the West Coast which does value add opportunities in office and MF. The team I am on is very small, and I only have one junior counterpart that has the same job responsibilities.\nWhile I was friendly to her at first, it quickly became apparent this person was massively incompetent and (by their own admission) had little clue how to do any work that wasn't filling in a template. Even then, there is a very real chance that they mess it up. They have been spoken to multiple times by senior management, but it seems senior management will never fire them. Coworker has been in the workforce for way too long to not have developed the required attention to detail or financial modelling skills necessary for our role.\nI tried to help them the first 4-5 times because of our friendship, but I slowly realized this wasn't helping either of us. The worst thing is that they have no desire to get better at the role. If they ask for help its for me to do the task for them - not to show them how its done. I've been in the position of messing up at a prior job, but screwing up made me hungrier to get better. It is the exact opposite with this person.\nMeanwhile, I have been giving 110% since I joined. Both in work product and big picture of how I can add value. Management has noticed this, but I'm not getting much beyond \"great job, thanks\". I can't help but feel a very large sense of resentment that my coworker is getting paid more than me while being unable to do a large part of their job description. We're on the same promotion cycle as well.\nIt's hard to stay motivated given this reality. Should I ease on the throttle and start looking for other opportunities?\nTL; DR Coworker absolutely sucks. I don't. We're being treated differently compensation-wise and same promotion track wise. What should I do?",

It's unfortunate that the employer is always right and employees are wrong no matter the situation. I wonder if you are at my previous employer since you mentioned west coast developer.\nNo matter what management says, you are not on the same track and they will chose this person over you! Do not voice your concerns to management!! I guarantee that you will be out of the door in 1-3 months if you complain.\nIn my situation, I revamped the company tools, created the company offering memorandum, introduced them to a lender that saved them over $1 million on an office acquisition, tried to coach the moron manager who had no idea what a discount rate, sources & uses, and other basic concepts are for an acquisitions lead or manager, made continuous mistakes in a write up, had no idea you could link two separate excel files, and the list goes on.\nEnd of the day, I got fired for doing my job after 6 months. I have never worked so hard for an employer to get royally screwed. Luckily, I found a new job a month later at a new employer. It hasn't been easy but I have become a \"YES MAN\".\nThe market is challenging, start looking but it will take you 3 months to a year in the current market environment due to COVID. Also, I strongly suggest you stay away from small shops. It's mostly friends and family and no matter how much value you add, you might not be valued as much.\nStay calm, ease the throttle, don't communicate your frustration, become a \"YES MAN\" and start looking for a new opportunity (you can still network during COVID if you think creatively).\nIf you work for former tech guys who are now developers, we worked at the same shop. Good luck bud, going to be a fun roller coaster ride :)\nOP - please message me directly. I feel your pain and I can give some very strategic advise to help you weather the storm.",

Kinda weird for someone driving around $2M cars saying they have a treasure trove portfolio of CRE assets. \n2) I looked him up and only found a hand full of entities he controlled recorded on title. Doesn't have a huge portfolio - think 4-5 buildings in Orange County and Texas. I did however find his house in Pelican Hill (Newport Coast) which he surprisingly owned and bought for like $18M. But he took out a 2nd trust deed hard money loan on it from a sketchy \"loan to own\" type lender lmfao. \nWhere there's smoke there's fire.

I thought his story was pretty interesting and did some quick math/more research on him, it looks like (adjusted for inflation) he had around $287,545 saved in cash when he was 28 years old in which he invested 100% of it into the dotcom boom and cashed out before it bust. That roughly turned into around $862,635 which he invested into a strip center with only 10% down with owner financing. On top of that deal we found another deal in Orange County where he was able to use an SBA loan with 10% down as an owner user on a building that was way below market the foreclosed building also had structural issues in which the bank had to invest cash to improve the structure as required by the city; I believe he made a million or so on that deal which allowed him to 1031 into something bigger. The guy isn't a conventional REPE fund guy but I like to think that with some luck and key market timing he was able to build wealth slowly over time. ",

Cars like that are incredibly rare and expensive and not just anyone can order them. He may not be worth 300 mil (I actually doubt he is) but probably worth more than low seven figures. \nRentals on the cars.  According to @Merchant_of_Debt, his house was probably highly levered in the first place and he's funding various other aspects of his life/business from supplemental debt.  $4mm is more than enough down to get you an $18mm home.  I hate to sound rude, but he finds access to cars like that because it impresses credulous rubes.  The concept of \"he can afford XYZ so he must be rich!\" is all too common and generally all too wrong.  When you see tons of news about how wealthy someone is, or about their net worth, and not a lot of information regarding the basis of it... that's a red flag.  When someone plugs their \"real estate business\" by showing off how they own $15mm more of house than they need, and their fleet of supercars.... that's a red flag.  Think about all the hyper wealthy people in real estate you know about.  Generally speaking, we know some of the assets they or their company own.  Sure, they may be into super cars, but when they're interviewed, the focus is on what they do, not what they buy with the proceeds of what they do...                                    ",

Because otherwise all I'm hearing is that the car was ordered custom, which in no way means it cannot be used, rented, borrowed, etc by someone else.\nAnd sure, if his wife is a billionaire good for him!  The question isn't \"did he marry well,\" but rather (it is implied to be) \"what has he done in the RE world to afford such a lifestyle?\"\nAnd the answer to the latter question is \"nothing, apparently.\"  So if he's not raking it in as an investor/developer/owner, he's either financing a lavish lifestyle through debt in order to impress idiots who think that owning expensive cars is equivalent to any kind of successful career, or... he married well and is pretending that means he's a real estate guru?\nAnd no one is doubting his wealth because he \"flaunts\" it.  People doubt his (and those like him) wealth because all they seem to have are the \"flaunt\" parts and none of the \"here's where it comes from\" bits.  Ken Griffin bought a $238mm apartment in NYC last year.  But that is a symptom of his wealth, a result, and not a cause.  He's not wealthy because he bought that apartment, he's wealthy because he founded Citadel.  So with this Manny Khoshbin guy, where is his Citadel?  He has the flash of expensive cars and an (apparently over)-leveraged home (both of which are prime indicators of people living beyond their means, I'd argue), but where is the substance?  What assets does he own that pays for those cars and that home?  If you can't find or point to that, then of course the assumption is that the guy is a fraud.",

Hard to be mega rich and have one single source of income.\nIt's extremely easy to be mega rich and have one single source of income.  Go look at any extremely wealthy person - they didn't do it working two jobs, or with a side hustle.  They made their money by excelling at one thing, or succeeding at one thing, and whether they diversified or not is immaterial.  Again, since I brought him up earlier... I'm sure Ken Griffin makes millions and millions of dollars a year on various investments he's made.  But he's wealthy because of Citadel, not his $3mm Bitcoin investment profit or the real estate portfolio he's assembled.\nLets make something clear - people selling programs through YouTube videos of \"how to make it big in real estate\" are not UHNW individuals.  And if they are, their money comes from selling those programs, not from the real estate they purport to be experts in.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be spending all their time filming themselves unwrapping cars or touring their mansions - they'd be managing and expanding their real estate portfolio.  That is just common sense.\nHis website is literally a picture of himself and five small to medium size office rental properties.  Nothing else.  Given what else we know about him, it's almost a guarantee that if he owned anything else, he'd be publicizing that too.\nMr Khoshbin, like most snake oil salesmen before him, seems to have realized that the world is full of people asking to be duped, and who can't distinguish between how to create wealth and how to acquire the trappings of wealth.  He's draped himself in the language and accoutrements of a hyper-wealthy person, and people like you are eating it up.  In the 30 seconds of looking, I see he has like 5x as many videos about his cars as he does his real estate, which should tell you something in and of itself.  I even listened to one of his videos, which was titled \"How I made $12 Million Off One Building\" for reference.  And... at no point do you hear anything of value.  He doesn't \"break down the financials\".  He spouts off about how much he's increased rents by, or how much he claims he has, without giving any context.  Sure, he increased the value of the marina slips by $14,000/mo - but it took him 2 years and an undisclosed amount of money to do it.  Was some of it vacant?  How much did it cost him to build?  Did he borrow that money, is it equity?  For that matter, how much of his equity is syndicated out?  What kind of leverage does he have?  He claims to have converted dead space into rentable floor area, but the only business he could find willing to rent it was his own \"very lucrative\" cigar lounge.\nYou see what I mean?  He's telling you he has wealth, and showing you what he bought with that wealth, but there is absolutely nothing about his schtick which explains where that wealth is coming from and how it was generated.  A bunch of vague platitudes, and a \"look at my new car\" to distract.  I believe foolish people who don't do their research or who invest in get rich quick schemes deserve to lose their money, so I have no objection to this guy fleecing you or anyone else, but don't sit there and tell me he's done it through savvy real estate investing.",

I would think a situation like that would be rare however, since they are only paying themselves half of total promote at the time of the capital event.  \nMy understanding is they are doing more deep value add/distressed.  They are buying w/ a floater and then refi into agency after a couple of years.  I imagine at the refi they are assuming a big cash out.  I wonder if they had a second capital event (supplemental loan on top of the fixed rate refi) if they would pay themselves again.  \nWhat do you make of this structure?  I think I prefer it to crystallization because you have an opportunity to increase your promote at the end of the hold vs. taking it all at the refi (theoretically a lower promote $$).  But also with crystallization you get it all at the refi and of course time value of money",

                "contentText": "So this is something that should only occur (in theory) or be worth doing where there is a major/significant \"cash event\"... like proceeds from a refinance, partial sale, or something allows a large distribution of cash AND there is still \"upside\" left in the deal. I have seen versions of this in large scale, master planned development, were significant value creation occurs after phase one is done (or even just entitlements received), but much is left for project (could be literally a decade). The whole point of crystallization is that all the legit, manager driven upside value has been created and its just cash flows and market appreciation there after. Thus, both parties are fine with \"crystallizing\" (freezing) the values of each position and then ending the whole promote structure. This can trigger a revaluation on the books of the manager/LP for their fund (meaning it could trigger a promote or bonus for the manager of the equity fund itself), thus has meaning without the need of selling or actually monetizing the asset.\nIn this scenario, you are getting cash, and can distribute BUT you still want the manager (GP) to be incentivized to maximize value of the deal going forward (still more real work to do), so you only partially pay out the promote (so the manager can bonus all their junior monkeys who fought so hard for carry!!), while still allowing for it to grow and incentives to stay aligned. \nI guess the bottom line is you would do this or something like it, when it makes sense given the nature/structure of the deal. Large scale developments, with multiple phases are the most obvious, but I'm sure it makes sense in other situations. It could also work to allow the proceeds from the refi/recap to be \"rolled\" to the next phase or deal, with a fresh promote, but still keep this one alive. Frankly, crystallization only makes sense when deal is basically done but parties do not want to sell or have no need to sell. Plus, with a crystallization, you could allow for all sorts of entry/exit trades by LP investors and GP investors for that matter, as the new valuation is now \"clean\". With the refinance/recap producing cash, the mechanics could actually be messier (so you could do the crystallization, allow trades to clear, then the new entity/owners could go back and refi/recap if they want to harvest cash). In short, just do what ever the hell makes everyone happy and can agree on (that latter point can be easier said than done!). ",

                "contentText": "Regarding compensation, it\u2019s all over the map. For the majority of brokerages, minus a few such as Eastdil Secured, it\u2019s 100% commission. You really can\u2019t give an average. With that said, if you are familiar with the titles at each firm, and what gross commissions go with those titles, you can take a guesstimate of what that producer makes. For instance, if you know that to reach Executive Vice President at CBRE in Manhattan, a producer must have a minimum average gross commission income of $1.8MM over five years, you can guesstimate what they net. He advised, the range to the next level might be $4MM dollars. So your net figure could be off by a large factor. But it\u2019s a good minimum starting point. \nRegarding question 2. Sure, you see if happen. But it is personality dependent. The two part answer: 1) Acquisitions and brokerage are similar but different. Both are sales roles. But in acquisitions, you also have the analysis aspect many people enjoy. You have internal selling. You can pass on bad deals. In brokerage, you don\u2019t care as much about analysis. It\u2019s all business development. Build a team to do the analysis and execution so you can go find more clients and make more money. 2) It\u2019s really hard when you\u2019re senior level to pick up and move to a full commission job. Sure, you could make a lot more money. But you\u2019re leaving a salary + bonus + healthcare + 401 K and other benefits for full commission. And you probably have a family at that point and need a lot of your salary to live off of. Although people do it at all stages, it\u2019s easiest to become a broker when your income needs are lower as you will hopefully reach what you need sooner. Remember, brokers usually make good money (subjective), but there is survivorship bias. No one hears of a struggling broker because they don\u2019t last. ",

One MD who is our firms \u2018rainmaker\u2019 made a killing in 2018 he brought in around $15m in revenue so made a $3.75m bonus but this isn\u2019t the norm, but just goes to show how variable it is.\nNote: yes our pay is lower than IBD but our hours are better.

VPs and directors around 50hrs and MDs are usually out with clients discussing the market and originating transactions so they\u2019re only in the office for around 20-30 hours per week.",

Essentially trying to perceive their market value, if this is a good place to build a career given their growth trajectory and continuous push into different business lines, etc. I guess I would say they are a much younger Hines in the sense that Hines grew up as an office developer and diversified into other asset classes, REPE, etc. Greystar grew up on multifamily and is now similarly diversifying. Would people say Greystar has the same market perception as Hines from an employee standpoint ? Is it as much of a breeding ground for spin-offs as Hines was ?",

Greystar is a very well known, respected firm. How to rate it against Hines, Related, or... Blackstone??? Who knows!!! But who cares......\nTo answer your question.... YES this could be a great place to build a career.... All firms have their own character, they seem to have a good one from my perspective (known a few people their, including some who got poached from my current firm tbh). Know people at and have been at Hines and Related (fewer at Blackstone tbh), they have goods and bads to say about each, I'm sure similar at Greystar.\nI'd guess if you posted a \"I started at Greystar AMA\" type thread on WSO, you would get few to zero \"why would you ever work there?\" style questions/posts. I think it fits the top tier \"prestige\" level for most on the WSO real estate forum (others... feel free to disagree.... but I'd bet solid money many 'prospects' on here would kill for a legit role at Greystar).",

Just as people are careful when they invest in a deal, they are also careful when they choose who they will delegate the responsibility of investing to.",

Hines started as office developer and now (especially in Europe) they are heavily investing on PRS/student housing.\nGreystar, on the other hand, may be smaller than Hines in terms of AUM, but their leadership in \"living\" assets is worldwide recognized. If you have the chance to join Greystar do it, definitely a great place.\nAlso, if I may add, I think it's way more interesting to work for a developer (like Hines/Greystar) rather than a typical LP (including large REPEs), as you are directly involved in basically everything (scouting, underwriting, due diligence). LPs just give you money and ask questions.",

                "contentText": "Greystar\u2019s brand trajectory has grown leaps and bounds over the past decade.  I wrote in another post that there is little in the way of stopping them from being the top shop for vertically integrated multifamily investment and development platform.  If they are going into other product types then I\u2019m confident they will excel.  \n  With that said, their property management is winning deals and I don\u2019t see anyone catching up with them there in terms of scale (they acquired Riverstone in 2014, then the #2).  \n  The Greystar brand will continue to become a household name.  Even with laypersons (via Greystar managed apartments).  \n  I think what makes Greystar successful are a few things:\n- roots in the Trammel Crow Residential model of hiring entrepreneurial, typically MBA/Master\u2019s educated MD\u2019s to build markets (typically acquisitions mind-skillsets), but with the backing of the Greystar organization.  That is a good alignment of start up and established company. Bucks the long-standing \u201cyou must have grey hairs to lead\u201d culture that CRE used to be dominated by.\n- I think the growing brand attracts more and more top talent.  The platform is growing so there are more top jobs (MD, Senior MD) to dole out.  And the size of the projects/deals, on the GP side is substantial and people are onboard for that to make a career.  The long period of the projects, locks in the talent.  The platform is so broad geographically that your desire to live anywhere could be met. \n- while Chicken-and-Egg, Greystar benefited greatly from the long term trend of disintermediation in CRE, and having the right platform at the right time.  And they\u2019ve executed.  Their big moves globally can only happen programmatically and with global investors - the sources of funds that power the investment management world.  By being really good at portfolio management/big picture and then executing on national and regional levels, do you get to see what Greystar has accomplished.  I\u2019m going to guess, global investors have goals and Greystar is good at anticipating what their current and future goals will be - and voila Greystar is positioned to be the go-to.  They act like a nimble company with a huge platform, that\u2019s hard to beat. \nSo the brand, ok you can ride it.  But what do you think you are going to get from the experience?  \n  I\u2019d sum it up in two words: Push You.  While not unlike other high performing firms, Greystar is not a place that you can fall into a trance and get comfortable.  There is simply too much growth, improvement, adjacencies, challenging, bar raising, competition from peers and below.  Personality wise Bob Faith is very different from his former business partner Barry Sternlicht (Starwood), and I\u2019m guessing here, but the DNA of Greystar is smart, hard working, cordial with a Southern charm, dependable, thorough, and do the right thing.  I think this ethos goes well with public fund managers of global capital, who tend to be really good people.  \n  The challenge for Greystar is to retain that culture, down to the regions. Whether the newer generation maintains that \u201cCharleston balance\u201d (keeping the HQ there should help) is yet to be seen.  \n  It\u2019s been great watching the company do well and ESPECIALLY getting the attention of you ambitious monkeys.

You want to make sure you're in for the right basis in the event you need to tear down and build a traditional warehouse.\nBecause of the relatively high PSF rents they are slightly more difficult to finance (all in relation to traditional warehouse and dependent on location).\nEDIT: Sorry just noticed that you are the lender here. Obviously it depend on your sponsor and if they have a history of making good buys in that space. Truck terminals are generally around ports or rail yards but can be anywhere depending on the businesses needs. If the property you're looking for is close to either of those it can easily be re-leased. If not it can still be easily re-leased but you'll need another tenant who has a reason to be there. The fall back is always land basis for warehouse conversion.",

Company Financials are solid but I dont have much experience with these type of facilities. Would be more comfortable with a tenant like Fedex. Anybody have any experience with these? Are rents higher than your typical manufacturing facility or distrubution warehouse? Harder to re-tenant? And because of the small square footage, the debt/SF is much higher than your typically industrial property so that is also making me nervous as a lender.\nTruck terminals are indeed a subset of industrial. I have analyzed and acquired multiple truck terminals, so feel free to ask me anything as I have a fairly good understanding of them at this point.\n'Per SF' measurements are incorrect in the context of truck terminals. Terminals are measured on a per door basis for almost everything. Rent is always on a per door per month basis or a whole dollar amount.\nOn a SF basis, rent is always going to be substantially higher and likely in the teens or low twenties per SF NNN. The last time I checked, truck terminals cost ~$180,000 - $200,000 per door to develop (>$250/SF), and they are almost always BTS. I have not seen any truck terminals trade at or above replacement cost, and practically nobody is developing them right now because construction costs are too high to pencil and municipalities will not permit them.\nLike any specialized use, re-tenanting is going to be more difficult than your traditional warehouse/DC, but not impossible. It just requires a tenant that needs a truck terminal. I'd probably add another 3-6 months onto down time assumptions.\nLastly, expanding on SHB said, truck terminals typically serve as inter-modal facilities. Goods passing through the terminal stay there for a couple of hours at max. Outside of ports/rail yards, you'll see them in large metros or in sub-markets that have a lot of big box distribution centers. FedEx has a ton of them place strategically in very rural markets. With regards to getting in at the right basis in order to tear down, there is a 0.00% change you'd ever been competitive on a development if you had to tear down a terminal and build industrial. We just bought a truck terminal at >$425,000 per acre. It would make way more sense to sit on the terminal until you can lease it again.",

So in essence, analysts are who actually good at what they do are being compensated well and being treated better at their firms. All that is left is average to subpar talent, who wouldn\u2019t even make it to a second round interview. Also gotta remember real estate is still an arcane industry to most.

In addition to my relevant experience, I've networked my *** off talking with more than 100 people in the industry over the last 12 months, which while incredibly insightful hasn't yielded much success in terms of interviews landed or offers despite getting recommendations/referrals from everyone I asked. The only places that I've got looks this year to this point have been at 2 MF's (think BX/KKR/TPG/Apollo) where I got dinged in the 2nd and 3rd rounds. I've always found it strange that MF's gave me legitimate looks, however, nobody else has to this point. \nFrom my perspective on the outside looking in, the analyst shortage keeps getting talked about but most of the people in my network that have made moves are the ones that already have analyst jobs or were in the right place at the right time within the company (know several regional BO employees who are now at GS/MS IB in top groups who previously had no relevant experience).

The analyst landscape for IB/MF's is far more competitive. Quality RE Analysts seem to be extremely hard to come by due to the arcane perception of the industry and the fact that there is far less demand for RE jobs (surprisingly few people outside of the CRE community know that CRE is even an industry much less how lucrative it can be). For reference I managed to land a role as an analyst with zero prior experience due to the insane deal flow in 2021. I was let go and found another analyst role within 2 months even with the holiday slowdown.",

There is without-a-doubt a shortage and I think this can be attributed to the unconventional nature of the real estate industry. If you weren\u2019t born and raised around RE/banking/construction, real estate is not a natural career path to follow during and after undergrad. Pay is a factor as well - I am seeing equal job descriptions from like-like companies with one offering salary of 60-70k and the other over 100k. Not surprised there\u2019s a lot of vacancies for firms with unrealistic salary expectations.",

They are currently raising their second fund.\nOn the debt side, they mostly do senior RE loans, with little exposure to mezz or other tranches.

In general, I think the capital markets side of brokerage is seen as more analytical on the junior level and offers much better placement into other parts of real estate as compared to leasing.\nA final note on firms: Eastdil is the 800-pound gorilla when it comes to capital markets and positions itself as more of a real estate investment bank and less of a real estate brokerage firm (even though the distinction is immaterial at best). Their analysts/associates seem to be paid better than other firms and have better exit opportunities on the buy-side.

Could you possibly elaborate on the main differences between landlord rep and tenant rep leasing brokers ( besides the obvious). Is either viewed in a more favorable light?\nI would draw distinctions between brokers a different way. (I think this varies by office/market size)\nI would classify a broker by Office, Industrial, or Retail for leasing and then also Investment Sales. Some much larger markets are big enough to sustain someone who say, only works in Hospitals or only works in Hotels or something but this is few and far inbetween.\nWithin each property specialty there are landlord and tenant reps. Landlord rep and tenant rep are no more or less prestigious than one another. Landlord (also called \"Agency\" brokers win a building listing and are told \"fill it & raise rents.\" Tenant brokers win a listing and are told \"find us the best place for the best price considering this, this, and this factor). Sometimes a broker will do both. Sometimes (more often in Office) a broker will pick one and stick with it.\nLandlord reps usually get paid 2% for the first 5 years, 1% after that. Tenant reps get a 4%/2% split. (This is really just generalization. The numbers change. Point is, tenant reps usually get paid more per deal.) It evens out though because as a landlord rep your deal flow is usually higher. As a tenant rep the amount of companies you can represent is limited by time and good faith (i.e. you don't want to represent two nearly identical banks and then try to convince each that you have their best interest in mind), but as a landlord rep you're basically telling all potential tenants \"my building is better than this building you're also looking at\" so there is less risk for overlap.",

As a result, though, it seems much easier to get hired into brokerage from a non-traditional background than into other parts of finance.\nThis is all spot on. Something else to consider when it comes to compensation though is income beyond commissions. Almost all established brokers I know also own their own commercial properties giving them a \"monthly paycheck\" between hitting home run commissions. The sales cycle in brokerage can be 12-18 months (if not more) and it adds additional income and some bill paying stability to the process.\nAlso, along with the \"wider gap between top performers and moderate performers,\" this is true on a person to person level but also on a company to company level. The CRE brokerage community is being consolidated like never before, and unless you're in a market big enough to sustain tons of firms, if you're not in a top firm you're pretty much never going to hit it big. Until you're a rockstar, company name matters far more.\nTop: CBRE . Second: Colliers & JLL Third: Cushman, Cassidy, HFF . . Grubb? Local players? . . . . . . . . Everyone else",

By and large brokers are alpha males who are consistently jousting for new business, a better deal for their client, etc. There is no doubt that 10% of the brokers do 80-90% of the business, with probably around half of junior brokers filtering out of the business in their first three years. this is due to the draw system that most juniors operate on, ie, you are paid a draw or 20-30K, and the deals you close chip away at that draw before you actually turn a profit. If you don't work on a solid team, especially on the tenant side, it is very difficult to claw your way through the first few years.",

I'm lumping all types of brokerage, investment sales, office leasing, retail leasing, etc.\nBackground: I'm a junior broker working at a top 5 shop on a team in office leasing for the experience - applying to Columbia and MIT for 2013 commencement. I've had terrific deal exposure and variety, ranging from representing large (300k SF) clients in kicking off new developments, to listing work, to working with startup firms arranging flexible leases, all the while working on decks, being part of pitches/presentations, data analysis, and building and running DCF models.\nThis isn't what I'd want to do for life, not stimulating enough for me other than the money. But as a junior at a REPE, REIT, REIB, etc shop, wouldn't I be excel jockeying with little hands on experience? From what I've read and folks i've spoken to, the associate level is where things start to get a little more interesting.\nCheers, Chris",

I'm sure working in brokerage can be an interesting and rewarding experience where someone can cut their teeth in real estate and learn quite a bit. However, if you're comparing brokerage against a background like investment banking, then admittedly that gets more traction with employers in the REPE / REIT world.\nPart of the reason for that preference has to do with the real or perceived analytical intensity of the experience. While it sounds like you have gained some quality modeling and analytical experience through brokerage, I think most would agree that the ex-bankers they have worked with or employed tend to have a level of experience and training in this arena that exceeds their peers from the brokerage world. Another reason is simply selectivity. I-banking is viewed as a plus not just because of the skills acquired in the profession, but also because of the perception that the track is selective and delivers a somewhat \"pre-screened\" pool of applicants. This isn't to say there aren't great candidates from alternative backgrounds, but with limited time and resources to sift through potential hires, employers end up using rough, simple screening criteria to select interviewees.",

If you are in a shitty shop or on a shitty team, or trying to go it alone in your 20s, you are pretty screwed unless you are a complete rock star and somehow build a practice for yourself. Some of the young guys can make pretty good coin, but it is straight commissions.\nPersonally I wish I had done a few years on a top leasing team, gone back to MBA to learn finance and then gone into REPE or REIT. If you want to be a CEO, you need to know leasing. Most finance guys are void of this knowledge and it is where all of the value is created in real estate.",

It's interesting that most senior RE bankers I've met in Toronto have their training in the brokerage world - all investment sales. It was a route that I targeted during my post undergrad job hunt 1.5 years ago, as it skirts many of the formal IB recruitment requirements. I actually got quite close to a hire - they recommended I get a couple of years training in brokerage and come back to them. That being said, most senior guys I met with for advice recommended IB after you've got 10 or so years in the business because of the burnout factor for juniors.\nMogul: I meet your requirements for great experience, and it has given me some fantastic experiences to discuss on my MSRED apps. I've been blessed in Toronto to have a very strong mentor from the get-go who has been instrumental in making key introductions, which I believe I could leverage for an associate position at a great shop after a couple of years of experience and a strong school on my resume. That being said, I want to stick around NY after Columbia and the vast majority of my contacts are Canadian centric. My mentor said the exact same thing as your last sentence (and it's been repeated by at least two other top dogs i've met with) - leasing drives cash flows and are essential to the understanding of asset values, pricing trends, and even as CEO of a RE firm you will work on/approve the big leases in your portfolio. Working purely on leasing transactions though... i can't imagine how people do it their whole careers. (applies to OB23 comments as well)\n410: agreed. That is great you've had the opportunity to see different sides - sounds almost like CBRE's rotation (i think they call it the Wheel) program. Fantastic intro to the business IMO, and builds well rounded and knowledgeable professionals for the firm. One thing I've been warned about is getting pigeon-holed as a leasing guy. It's tricky because you don't start making decent money until your 3rd-4th year in leasing, and that's about the time you need to jump ship to avoid being branded.",

It is now January, and I have not heard back from HR or my boss (Team of 2...now 3, as a VP was hired above me).  My company has a reputation for churning employees (they leave) because of the pay, but I took it because I was laid off for 4 months from my last job.\nAs an aside, PIP was partly me and being with a SEVERE micromanaging boss. During this time I took my PIP seriously, and was even diagnosed with ADHD and started on adderal.  My performance was increased since I started taking my meds.\nAnyone know what to do.  I recently got an offer at JPM/Citi/Wells as a PM in residential real estate, for 20% more than I currently make and a VP title(a step up).  Bonus unknown at the prospective new bank.  The new bank is in Jersey City, but I've been told it is on the business side..which leaves me confused.\nI would rather stay at my job, but I think I saw a confidential posting on LinkedIn for a more junior position which I am 99% sure is with my company.\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this. I would like to stay in CRE, but I need a job to pay bills",

Namely, you would be able to claim a \"discrimination arising as a result of disability\" in case they try play games.\nShould they indeed bully you around, even by gradually eroding your role with the new hire you have mentioned - secure the next gig and send your current employer a without prejudice letter offering them a solution to their problem: you will leave quietly in return for a settlement payment. It is not hostage situation but you are offering everyone a best deal including yourself. There is a less nuclear option by asking HR for their grievance policy and further raising one, which might give you a bit more time to secure next role, do background checks and a good way to prepare for a litigation.\nIf you do not have next role secured and they try to unfairly dismiss you then it would be much harder. You will need to instruct a solicitor to obtain an injunction against your employers actions.\nOnce again, you are an employee and you need to look out for your best interest.

How does HR look at a resume which is slighly different, meaning that when i submitted it my \"current job\" was 2021- present. and when they background check it will be to 2023.  Should I be admiting to the potential other hiring manager that I am looking.  All they know if that I am interested in this other position, not that I have a time clock on my job here(potentially).",

For example, how do you maintain housing affordability when you can't meaningfully move forward construction for 1/3 of the year due to weather?&nbsp; The same could be said for other infrastructure demands such as roads, bridges, and etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I mean... you do understand that construction takes place in winter, all the time?&nbsp; This isn't an issue, at all.&nbsp; Excavation can be more expensive in winter, sure.&nbsp; And pouring winterized concrete is more expensive than pouring regular concrete in the summer.&nbsp; But these are marginal costs, and can be completely avoided by timing construction appropriately.&nbsp; Other than those two there is literally no difference except the discomfort of the laborers... but the same can be said for building in the summer in Texas.</p>\n<p>This is a non-issue.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I should point out that we are already starting to see some of these impacts when it comes to water rates.&nbsp; Phoenix is raising rates in a manner that implies a <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2023/07/07/phoenix-water-rates-increase-sharply-2023-what-you-need-to-know/70371017007/\" rel=\"nofollow\">48% increase in costs</a> (assuming today's usage remains the same).&nbsp; North Texas is going to see <a href=\"https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/north-texans-may-see-higher-water-bills/287-dca24f1b-a793-43e6-8b18-07e3f5214136#:~:text=COLLIN%20COUNTY%2C%20Texas%20%E2%80%94%20Some%20North,to%20%243.77%20pe\" rel=\"nofollow\">an increase of 11%</a>.&nbsp; These kinds of increases are going to be the new normal, and that adds up.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>",

Texas is still cheaper at all levels though, and I think it's more clear as you get older. For instance, getting a starter home in one of the higher end neighborhoods of LA like Brentwood is probably running $3M+ these days. That same size home in Westlake Austin, the premier neighborhood in Austin, is probably closer to $1.2 - $1.5M. The gross property tax will still be higher on the Brentwood property but everyone in Brentwood sends their kids to $40k+ per year per kid private schools, while the folks in Westlake have a top ranked public school system for free. Throw in the savings on income taxes, gas being half price, food/entertainment generally being slightly cheaper, nannies being cheaper and living in Texas ends up being a lot cheaper for the higher income family.  You're basically talking that the young family wanting to live in Brentwood with 2-3 kids needing to make well over $1M a year to afford that house payment, private school, etc. without breaking the bank, vs. the family in Austin could do it closer to $400k - $500k.  Generally speaking, I don't think the difference in compensation between the states is that drastic, meaning Texas still comes out significantly ahead. The problem is just that you have to live in Texas. How much is that perfect weather and big city lifestyle worth to someone?\n\nLA also has basically 0 places that are within a 1.5 hour commute where a young family without at least $400k - $500k in combined income could afford to buy a home and send their kids to a good school.
